# ASC 606 PDF Processing PoC

## Overview

This project is a multi-standard accounting analysis platform that generates complete contract analyses under various accounting standards (ASC 606, ASC 842, etc.). The system takes contracts as input and produces structured professional memos following the specific methodology of each standard, using authoritative FASB guidance and Big 4 interpretative publications as primary sources, with LLM general knowledge as fallback for edge cases.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Hybrid RAG Architecture
- **Frontend**: Single Streamlit application (`contract_analyzer_app.py`)
- **Backend**: Hybrid ASC 606 analyzer (`hybrid_asc606_analyzer.py`) with two-stage citation system
- **Knowledge Base**: ChromaDB vector database (`asc606_knowledge_base.py`) with semantic search
- **Document Processing**: Multi-format text extraction (`document_extractor.py`)
- **Source Documents**: Authoritative ASC 606 sources in `attached_assets/`

### Core Components
- **Hybrid RAG System**: Combines metadata filtering with semantic search for precise results
- **Two-Stage Citation Process**: Stage 1 (extract verbatim quotes), Stage 2 (assemble analysis)
- **ChromaDB Vector Database**: Stores ASC 606 paragraphs with metadata for semantic search
- **Multi-document Processing**: Handles up to 5 files (contracts, invoices, amendments)
- **Professional Memo Generation**: Creates Big 4 quality accounting memos with auditable citations
- **Source Transparency**: Tracks hybrid RAG chunks used and relevance scores
- **Performance Optimization**: Cached analyzer and persistent vector database

### Future Architecture Considerations
- **Database Integration**: Planned for storing analysis history, user preferences, and cached results
- **Multi-tenant Support**: User accounts and organization-level access controls
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of analyses for compliance and review purposes

## Key Components

### 1. PDF Processing (`processors/pdf_processor.py`)
- **Multi-library Support**: Fallback strategy using unstructured, pdfplumber, and PyPDF2
- **Chapter-specific Extraction**: Targeted extraction for Chapter 4 content (pages 63-83)
- **Content Analysis**: Structured extraction of text, tables, and examples
- **Rationale**: Multiple extraction libraries ensure robust parsing across different PDF formats

### 2. Chunk Processing (`processors/chunk_processor.py`)
- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent content segmentation respecting document boundaries
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable chunk size (200-2000 chars) and overlap (10-30%)
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Rich metadata attachment to each chunk
- **Rationale**: Semantic chunking preserves context better than simple character-based splitting

### 3. Quality Validation (`processors/quality_validator.py`)
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Text, structure, table, and example quality metrics
- **Threshold-based Validation**: Configurable quality thresholds (70-95%)
- **Issue Identification**: Automatic detection of processing problems
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improving quality
- **Rationale**: Ensures processed content meets professional standards for accounting documents

### 4. Metadata Enrichment (`utils/metadata_enricher.py`)
- **ASC 606 Specific Terms**: Recognition of accounting-specific terminology
- **Structural Analysis**: Section hierarchy and cross-reference detection
- **Content Classification**: Categorization of content types (definitions, examples, requirements)
- **Rationale**: Rich metadata enables better searchability and content understanding

### 5. File Management (`utils/file_utils.py`)
- **File Validation**: Size, type, and format checking
- **Hash Generation**: Content integrity verification
- **Metadata Extraction**: Comprehensive file information gathering
- **Rationale**: Ensures file integrity and provides audit trail
