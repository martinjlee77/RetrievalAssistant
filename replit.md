# ASC 606 PDF Processing PoC

## Overview

This project is a multi-standard accounting analysis platform that generates complete contract analyses under various accounting standards (ASC 606, ASC 842, etc.). The system takes contracts as input and produces structured professional memos following the specific methodology of each standard, using authoritative FASB guidance and Big 4 interpretative publications as primary sources, with LLM general knowledge as fallback for edge cases.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

### Future Architecture Considerations
- **Database Integration**: Planned for storing analysis history, user preferences, and cached results
- **Multi-tenant Support**: User accounts and organization-level access controls
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of analyses for compliance and review purposes

## Key Components

### 1. PDF Processing (`processors/pdf_processor.py`)
- **Multi-library Support**: Fallback strategy using unstructured, pdfplumber, and PyPDF2
- **Chapter-specific Extraction**: Targeted extraction for Chapter 4 content (pages 63-83)
- **Content Analysis**: Structured extraction of text, tables, and examples
- **Rationale**: Multiple extraction libraries ensure robust parsing across different PDF formats

### 2. Chunk Processing (`processors/chunk_processor.py`)
- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent content segmentation respecting document boundaries
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable chunk size (200-2000 chars) and overlap (10-30%)
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Rich metadata attachment to each chunk
- **Rationale**: Semantic chunking preserves context better than simple character-based splitting

### 3. Quality Validation (`processors/quality_validator.py`)
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Text, structure, table, and example quality metrics
- **Threshold-based Validation**: Configurable quality thresholds (70-95%)
- **Issue Identification**: Automatic detection of processing problems
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improving quality
- **Rationale**: Ensures processed content meets professional standards for accounting documents

### 4. Metadata Enrichment (`utils/metadata_enricher.py`)
- **ASC 606 Specific Terms**: Recognition of accounting-specific terminology
- **Structural Analysis**: Section hierarchy and cross-reference detection
- **Content Classification**: Categorization of content types (definitions, examples, requirements)
- **Rationale**: Rich metadata enables better searchability and content understanding

### 5. File Management (`utils/file_utils.py`)
- **File Validation**: Size, type, and format checking
- **Hash Generation**: Content integrity verification
- **Metadata Extraction**: Comprehensive file information gathering
- **Rationale**: Ensures file integrity and provides audit trail

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User uploads PDF through Streamlit interface
2. **File Validation**: System validates file type, size, and integrity
3. **PDF Processing**: Extract text, structure, tables, and examples
4. **Content Chunking**: Create semantic chunks with overlap
5. **Quality Validation**: Score processing quality across multiple dimensions
6. **Metadata Enrichment**: Add comprehensive metadata to chunks
7. **Results Presentation**: Display processing results with quality metrics

## External Dependencies

### Required Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **unstructured**: Advanced PDF processing (optional)
- **pdfplumber**: PDF text extraction (optional)
- **PyPDF2**: Basic PDF handling (optional)

### Optional Integrations
- **Logging**: Python standard library for comprehensive logging
- **Pathlib**: Modern path handling
- **Datetime**: Timestamp generation

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **Environment**: Python virtual environment with requirements.txt
- **Configuration**: Settings-based configuration in `config/settings.py`
- **Data Storage**: Local file system for temporary processing

### Production Considerations
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture allows for easy scaling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and recovery
- **Security**: File validation and size limits prevent abuse
- **Performance**: Configurable processing parameters for optimization

### Configuration Management
- **Processing Settings**: Centralized configuration for all processing parameters
- **Quality Thresholds**: Adjustable quality standards
- **Chapter-specific Settings**: Target pages and expected content metrics
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable specific processing features

The architecture prioritizes modularity, error resilience, and quality assurance while maintaining flexibility for different PDF formats and processing requirements. The system is designed to handle the specific challenges of accounting document processing while providing clear feedback on processing quality and potential issues.
