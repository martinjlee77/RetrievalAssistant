# ASC 606 Contract Analyzer - System Overview for Gemini LLM

## Project Purpose
A sophisticated AI-powered accounting analysis platform that analyzes uploaded contracts (PDF/Word) and generates complete professional accounting memos following ASC 606 revenue recognition standards. The system combines authoritative FASB literature with Big 4 interpretative guidance to produce audit-ready analyses with forensic-level precision.

## Core Architecture: Hybrid RAG System
- **Hybrid RAG**: Combines metadata filtering with semantic search for precise guidance retrieval
- **Two-Stage Citation**: Stage 1 extracts verbatim contract quotes, Stage 2 assembles professional analysis
- **ChromaDB Vector Database**: Stores 1,510 chunks from 9 ASC 606 sections + EY guidance
- **Dynamic Semantic Search**: Adapts queries based on contract-specific terminology
- **Professional Memo Generation**: Creates Big 4 quality memos using CREW framework
