    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 3, 2026</em></p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the professional accounting advisory services (the "Services") provided by VeritasLogic.ai ("VeritasLogic," "we," "our," or "us"). By requesting or using our Services, you agree to these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1) Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer</strong>: The organization or individual entering into an agreement with VeritasLogic to use the Services.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Content</strong>: Files, contracts, draft memos, and other materials provided to VeritasLogic for analysis or review.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliverable</strong>: The technical accounting memo, gap analysis, or other output provided by VeritasLogic to Customer.</li>
      <li><strong>Order</strong>: A request for Services submitted through our contact form, email, or written agreement specifying the scope of work and pricing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Service Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Services Offered:</strong> VeritasLogic provides professional accounting advisory services, including (a) <strong>Memo Preparation:</strong> AI-powered analysis of contracts or documents to prepare technical accounting memos, and (b) <strong>Memo Review:</strong> AI-powered gap analysis and review of existing draft memos. Both services include human expert review and validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Services cover specified FASB standards (e.g., ASC 606, ASC 340-40, ASC 842, ASC 718, ASC 805). ASC 842 coverage is Lessee only; ASC 340-40 coverage is Cost to Obtain only.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Standard delivery is in DOCX format. PDF format is available upon request. Deliverables include paragraph-level ASC citations, technical analysis, and professional formatting.</li>
      <li><strong>Turnaround Time:</strong> We estimate delivery within 24 hours for standard transactions. This is an estimate, not a guarantee. If delays occur, we will communicate with you and work on a best-effort basis to complete the work promptly.</li>
      <li><strong>Revisions:</strong> One revision round is included with each service. Additional revisions may be available at additional cost, subject to mutual agreement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Professional Services Disclaimer; Customer Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advisory Services Only:</strong> Our Services constitute professional accounting advisory and consulting services. They do not constitute legal advice, audit services, assurance services, or the practice of law.</li>
      <li><strong>No Guarantee of Results:</strong> We provide advisory services based on information you provide. We do not guarantee specific accounting conclusions, audit outcomes, or regulatory compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Responsibility:</strong> <strong>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR:</strong> (a) reviewing, validating, and finalizing all Deliverables before use; (b) ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of all Deliverables for your specific circumstances; (c) obtaining any necessary legal, audit, or other professional advice before relying on Deliverables; (d) making all final decisions regarding accounting treatment, disclosures, and documentation; and (e) ensuring compliance with all applicable accounting standards, regulations, and professional requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> The Services use generative artificial intelligence. AI-generated outputs may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies and may not be unique. All outputs must be independently verified for accuracy and appropriateness by a qualified professional before use.</li>
      <li><strong>No Reliance Without Review:</strong> You acknowledge that Deliverables are advisory in nature and should not be used without your independent professional review and validation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Customer Content; Data Handling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Background Processing:</strong> We process documents using background jobs that continue even if you close your browser. Original uploaded files are not stored after processing is complete.</li>
      <li><strong>Memo Retention:</strong> De-identified memo outputs and analysis metadata (e.g., date, standard, document size, service type) are retained to enable access to your completed analyses and for billing and support purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Our AI partner retains API request data for 30 days for abuse monitoring, after which it is automatically deleted. Your data is not used to train AI models. We implement automated de-identification (party names replaced with generic identifiers) before processing. You are responsible for reviewing the de-identification preview and confirming that the party identification and text replacements are acceptable before proceeding with analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to provide Customer Content and to instruct our processing under these Terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitive Data:</strong> Do not upload regulated personal data or special categories (e.g., PHI under HIPAA, cardholder data under PCI‑DSS) unless we agree in writing.</li>
      <li>Additional details on how we handle personal information are in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not misuse the Services, including by: violating laws or third‑party rights; providing unlawful or harmful content; attempting to access our systems without authorization; interfering with or overloading the Services; reverse engineering or circumventing security; using the Services for high‑risk activities where failure could lead to death, personal injury, or severe environmental or property damage.</li>
      <li>Do not resell, sublicense, or offer the Services on a service bureau basis without our prior written consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Fees and Payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard Services:</strong> Standard memo preparation or review services are priced at $750 per memo. This includes AI-powered analysis, human expert review, and one revision round.</li>
      <li><strong>Complex Transactions:</strong> For complex transactions (multi-element arrangements, M&A, unusually long contracts), we provide custom quotes. Custom pricing will be agreed upon in writing before work begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Payment is due upon receipt of the Deliverable and invoice. We will send a secure Stripe payment link along with your final draft invoice. For custom engagements or enterprise clients, we may offer Net 30 payment terms, subject to credit approval.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Fees are exclusive of taxes; you are responsible for applicable taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Non‑Payment:</strong> We may suspend or withhold Deliverables for non‑payment or if your payment method fails. Interest may accrue on overdue amounts at the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We may change pricing for future orders; we will provide notice of material changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before Work Begins:</strong> You may cancel a request before we begin work without charge. Once we confirm we have begun work on your request, cancellation is not permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>No Refunds After Work Begins:</strong> Once work has commenced, fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as expressly agreed in writing for custom engagements.</li>
      <li><strong>Our Right to Decline:</strong> We reserve the right to decline any request for Services at our sole discretion, including if we determine the work is outside our scope, presents ethical concerns, or for any other reason.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ownership—VeritasLogic:</strong> We and our licensors own all rights, title, and interest in and to our Services, including software, workflows, models, documentation, and branding, subject only to the licenses expressly granted here.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership—Customer:</strong> As between the parties, Customer owns Customer Content. Customer owns the specific Deliverables generated from Customer Content, subject to our right to use anonymized data for service improvement.</li>
      <li><strong>License to Use:</strong> Upon payment in full, Customer receives a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use the Deliverables for its internal business purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you provide suggestions or feedback, you grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use and incorporate it without restriction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) Confidentiality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"Confidential Information" means information disclosed by one party to the other that is designated confidential or would reasonably be understood as confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure, including Customer Content, business plans, pricing, and security practices.</li>
      <li>Each party will protect the other's Confidential Information using at least reasonable care, and will not use or disclose it except to perform its obligations under these Terms or as required by law.</li>
      <li>Exclusions: Information that is or becomes public through no fault of the receiving party; already known without confidentiality obligations; independently developed; or rightfully obtained from a third party without confidentiality obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10) Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Services may interoperate with third‑party services (e.g., Stripe, OpenAI API, hosting providers). We are not responsible for third‑party services, their terms, or their privacy practices.</li>
      <li>We use AI services where request data is retained for 30 days for abuse monitoring only, then automatically deleted. Your data is not used to train models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11) Warranties; Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We will provide the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable professional standards for accounting advisory services.</li>
      <li><strong>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED, THE SERVICES AND ANY DELIVERABLES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR‑FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DELIVERABLES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE SUITABLE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING, VALIDATING, AND FINALIZING ALL DELIVERABLES BEFORE USE. THE SERVICES DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL, AUDIT, OR ASSURANCE SERVICES.</strong></li>
      <li>We do not guarantee any specific level of uptime or performance for the Services. The Services may be unavailable from time to time for maintenance, upgrades, or for reasons beyond our control.</li>
      <li>You acknowledge and agree that while we provide automated de-identification as a privacy enhancement, you are responsible for reviewing the preview of de-identified text and confirming it is acceptable before proceeding with analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12) Indemnification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>By Customer:</strong> Customer will defend and indemnify VeritasLogic and its affiliates, officers, directors, and personnel against claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from: (a) Customer Content; (b) Customer's use of Deliverables in violation of these Terms or law; (c) Customer's failure to review, validate, or properly use Deliverables; or (d) alleged infringement or violation of third‑party rights caused by Customer Content.</li>
      <li><strong>By VeritasLogic:</strong> VeritasLogic will defend and indemnify Customer against third‑party claims alleging that the Services (excluding Customer Content or third‑party services) infringe a U.S. patent, copyright, or trademark, or misappropriate a trade secret, and will pay damages finally awarded by a court or agreed in settlement. If the Services are enjoined or likely to be, we may procure a right to continue, modify the Services, or terminate the affected portion and refund fees paid for the discontinued functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, NOR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO VERITASLOGIC FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR $1,000 IF NO AMOUNTS WERE PAID).</strong></li>
      <li>The limitations above do not apply to a party's indemnification obligations, infringement of the other party's IP rights, or breach of confidentiality to the extent such limitations are prohibited by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14) Term; Termination; Suspension</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>These Terms continue while you request or use the Services. Either party may terminate for material breach if not cured within 30 days after written notice.</li>
      <li>We may suspend access immediately for security risks, suspected fraud or abuse, or non‑payment.</li>
      <li>Upon termination, your right to request new Services ends. We have no obligation to store Customer Content; please retain your own copies of Deliverables. We retain service records and billing records as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>15) Privacy and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> describes how we handle personal information.</li>
      <li>We implement security measures appropriate to our Services, including TLS 1.3 in transit, AES‑256 at rest on providers, and session‑based document processing. See our <a href="features.html#security">Security Overview</a>.</li>
      <li>For enterprise Customers requiring a Data Protection Addendum (DPA), contact <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>16) Publicity</h2>
    <p>We will not use your name or logo without your prior written consent. With consent, we may identify you as a customer and reference your use of the Services.</p>

    <h2>17) Export; Anti‑Corruption; Sanctions</h2>
    <p>You agree to comply with all applicable export control, anti‑corruption, and sanctions laws and regulations. You will not use the Services in, or for the benefit of, embargoed or sanctioned countries or parties.</p>

    <h2>18) Governing Law; Venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to its conflict of law rules. The parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in the county in which VeritasLogic's principal place of business is located.</p>

    <h2>19) Changes to the Services or Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify the Services or these Terms from time to time. We will post updated Terms with a new "Last updated" date and, for material changes, provide additional notice as required by law. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>20) Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h2>
    <p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve a dispute, we each agree to resolve such disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> The parties agree that each may bring claims against the other only in its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</li>
      <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language in the same venue as specified in Section 18, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>21) Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence:</strong> These Terms, any applicable Order, and any DPA constitute the entire agreement regarding the Services. If there is a conflict, the Order (if any) controls, then the DPA (for data protection matters), then these Terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Notices:</strong> We may provide notices via email or your account address. You may send notices to <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.</li>
      <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Failure to enforce any right is not a waiver.</li>
      <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Neither party is liable for delays or failures due to events beyond reasonable control.</li>
    </ul>
