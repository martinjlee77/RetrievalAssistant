    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 3, 2026</em></p>

    <p>VeritasLogic.ai ("VeritasLogic," "we," "our," or "us") provides professional accounting advisory services, including AI-powered memo preparation and review. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you visit our websites, request our services, or interact with us.</p>

    <h2>1) Scope</h2>
    <p>This Policy applies to website visitors, service requesters, and individuals who contact us (e.g., service inquiries, support). It does not apply to third‑party websites or services linked from our site.</p>

    <h2>2) Key definitions and roles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer</strong>: The organization or individual that contracts with VeritasLogic for professional services.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Content</strong>: Files, contracts, draft memos, and other documents provided to VeritasLogic for analysis or review, and the deliverables we generate.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an individual (e.g., name, email, IP address).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For Customer Content, we act as a processor/service provider, processing on behalf of the Customer under our agreement (and any data protection addendum, if applicable). For website, billing, and marketing data, we act as a controller/business.</p>

    <h2>3) Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact and profile</strong>: Name, business email, company, role/title, and preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing and transactions</strong>: Processed by Stripe. For our records, we retain limited billing metadata, such as the transaction amount, date, service type, and the last four digits of the card used.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Content</strong>: Information about your service requests, including file names, dates, document sizes, service type (preparation or review), and de-identified memo outputs. Original uploaded files are not stored. De-identified memo outputs (with party names replaced by generic identifiers) are retained to enable access to your completed analyses and for billing and support purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage and device data</strong>: IP address, browser type, pages visited, timestamps, and feature interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications</strong>: Messages you send via forms, email, or support channels (e.g., service requests, revisions, general inquiries).</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Essential cookies for site functionality and session management; limited analytics/performance cookies to improve our website and service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provide and improve our services</strong>: Process service requests; generate memos and gap analyses; maintain service history; provide deliverables.</li>
      <li><strong>Operate, secure, and troubleshoot</strong>: Monitor performance, prevent fraud/abuse, detect security incidents, and fix bugs.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing and account administration</strong>: Process service payments; maintain invoices/receipts; manage service records and billing history.</li>
      <li><strong>Support and communications</strong>: Respond to inquiries, manage service requests and revisions, send service notices and updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Service development</strong>: Improve workflows and quality using aggregated or de‑identified data where appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing (optional)</strong>: Send product updates or newsletters; you can opt out at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Our Purposes for Using Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide Our Services</strong>: We use your information to fulfill our contract with you, such as processing your service requests, generating deliverables, and handling billing.</li>
      <li><strong>For Legitimate Business Interests</strong>: We use data to operate and improve our services, secure our platform from fraud and abuse, and provide customer support.</li>
      <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: For activities like sending marketing emails or using non-essential cookies, we will rely on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations</strong>: We may need to use or retain your information to comply with legal requirements, such as for tax and accounting purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) How we handle Customer Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Background processing with memo retention</strong>: We process your documents using background jobs that continue even if you close your browser. Original uploaded files are not stored. De-identified memo outputs and analysis metadata (e.g., date, standard, document size, service type) are retained to enable access to your completed analyses and for billing and support purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Outputs</strong>: We generate memo outputs (DOCX/PDF) for you to download. Please retain your own copies.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional services</strong>: When you request our services, we access Customer Content only as directed by you, solely to provide those services, and under confidentiality obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Model training and AI processing</strong>: We do not use Customer Content to train AI models. Our AI analysis partner (OpenAI) retains API request data for 30 days for abuse monitoring, after which it is automatically deleted. Your data is not used to train AI models. Additionally, we implement automated de-identification to replace party names with generic identifiers before processing, providing an extra layer of privacy protection. You are responsible for reviewing the de-identification preview to confirm the party identification and replacements are acceptable before proceeding. If you need assistance with de-identification, please contact support@veritaslogic.ai.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Sharing and disclosures</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell Personal Information or share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising.</p>
    <p>We may disclose Personal Information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers/subprocessors</strong>: Hosting and infrastructure (providers with SOC 2 Type II–compliant environments), payment processing (Stripe), email/support tools, document processing infrastructure, and AI API providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional services reviewers</strong>: Human expert reviewers (former Big 4 Partners and SMEs), under confidentiality, when providing our services.</li>
      <li><strong>Business operations</strong>: Advisors (legal/accounting), auditors, or potential acquirers or transferees in a corporate transaction, under appropriate confidentiality.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal and safety</strong>: Where required by law, court order, or to protect rights, safety, and the integrity of our users and services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may update subprocessors as needed; material changes for contracted Customers will be communicated per the DPA or agreement.</p>

    <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer Content files</strong>: Processed in a temporary session; not stored after analysis completes.</li>
      <li><strong>Service history entries</strong>: Retained to provide your service history and for billing/records, while your relationship with us is active and as required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Account, billing, and support records</strong>: Retained for the duration of the relationship and as required by applicable laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing preferences</strong>: Retained until you opt out or request deletion, or for the minimum period necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) Security</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest on our providers (AES‑256 where applicable).</li>
      <li>Session‑based document processing; no persistent storage of uploaded files after analysis completion.</li>
      <li>AI processing with privacy controls: Our AI partner retains request data for 30 days for abuse monitoring only (automatically deleted thereafter). Your data is never used to train models. Automated de-identification replaces party names with generic identifiers before analysis.</li>
      <li>Access controls, logging, and monitoring appropriate for our service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>. For an overview of our security posture, see our <a href="features.html#security">Security Overview</a>.</p>

    <h2>10) International transfers</h2>
    <p>We may process Personal Information in the United States and other countries where we or our service providers operate. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) and implement additional controls as needed.</p>

    <h2>11) Your privacy rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your Personal Information; object to or restrict processing; and withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To exercise rights, contact <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>. We may need to verify your identity. If we process Personal Information as a processor for a Customer, we will direct you to that Customer (the controller) to fulfill your request.</p>

    <h2>12) Event registration</h2>
    <p>When you register for a VeritasLogic event or demo, we collect your name, email, company, and role to process your registration and send confirmations, reminders, related materials, and follow ups. We rely on legitimate interests or consent, as applicable. We use service providers (e.g., Microsoft Teams and email delivery platforms) to process this information. You can opt out of non transactional communications at any time. We retain event registration data for up to 12 months unless you request deletion.</p>

    <h2>13) California (CCPA/CPRA) and other U.S. state rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell Personal Information or share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising.</li>
      <li>You may request access, correction, or deletion of Personal Information, and information about our data practices.</li>
      <li>We do not discriminate for exercising your rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Submit requests to <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>. You may designate an authorized agent; we will require proof of authorization and verification.</p>

    <h2>14) Cookies and analytics</h2>
    <p>We use essential cookies for site functionality (e.g., session management) and may use limited analytics/performance cookies to improve the site and product experience. You can control cookies via your browser settings and, where required, via our cookie banner. Disabling cookies may impact functionality.</p>

    <h2>15) Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to individuals under 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children. If you believe a child provided us Personal Information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.</p>

    <h2>16) Communications and marketing</h2>
    <p>You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking unsubscribe or contacting <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>. We may still send transactional or service‑related communications (e.g., service confirmations, billing notices).</p>

    <h2>17) Data protection addendum (DPA)</h2>
    <p>Enterprise Customers that require a DPA can contact <a href="mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai">support@veritaslogic.ai</a>. We process Customer Content strictly under your instructions and the terms of our DPA and agreement.</p>

    <h2>18) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated Policy with a new "Last updated" date. For material changes, we will provide additional notice as required by law. Your continued use of the services after an update constitutes acceptance.</p>
