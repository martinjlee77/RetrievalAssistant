                <h2>How VeritasLogic.ai Started</h2>
                
                <p>VeritasLogic.ai was founded by a Big 4 audit veteran with 20+ years supporting Fortune 500 clients across tech, biotech, consumer, and retail. The company began in 2024 with a simple but powerful vision: harness the transformative power of AI to automate the technical analysis process that consumes so much of accounting professionals' time.</p>
                
                <p>After decades in audit and accounting, working with companies like Amazon, Oracle, Google, and Peloton, we witnessed firsthand how difficult, time-consuming, and high-pressure technical accounting can be. Revenue recognition, lease accounting, and business combination analyses, to name a few, often become the primary focus of both management teams and auditors—and for good reason. Incorrect treatment of these complex standards can be material and carries significant risk.</p>
                
                <p>Yet we also saw something else: much of this critical work follows predictable analytical patterns. Skilled professionals were spending days on routine contract analysis and memo drafting, work that could potentially be automated without sacrificing quality. We codified those patterns into a rigorous analysis workflow, backed by a standards-specific knowledge base and a memo structure auditors expect.</p>
                
                <p>That realization sparked VeritasLogic.ai. We set out to create an AI platform that understands FASB standards, audit requirements, and the rigorous documentation needs of technical accounting practice. We serve Fortune 500 controllers, CAOs, and technical accounting teams who need speed without compromising audit readiness.</p>

                    <h3>Why Our Independence Matters</h3>
                    <p>VeritasLogic.ai is privately, employee-owned. That independence lets us focus on one thing—our customers. We don't optimize for outside investors or quarterly targets. We optimize for accuracy, responsiveness, and long-term trust. When you need a feature, a fix, or a review, we can move quickly because our priorities are aligned with yours.</p>
