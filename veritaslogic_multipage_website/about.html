                <h2>How VeritasLogic.ai Started</h2>
                
                <p>VeritasLogic.ai began in 2024 with a simple but powerful vision: harness the transformative power of AI to automate the technical analysis process that consumes so much of accounting professionals' time.</p>
                
                <p>After 20+ years in audit and accounting, working with Fortune 500 companies across tech, biotech, consumer products, and retail, we witnessed firsthand how difficult, time-consuming, and high-pressure technical accounting can be. Revenue recognition, lease accounting, and business combination analyses, to name a few, often become the primary focus of both management teams and auditorsâ€”and for good reason. Incorrect treatment of these complex standards can be material and carries significant risk.</p>
                
                <p>Yet we also saw something else: much of this critical work follows predictable analytical patterns. Skilled professionals were spending days on routine contract analysis and memo drafting, work that could potentially be automated without sacrificing quality.</p>
                
                <p>That realization sparked VeritasLogic.ai. We set out to create an AI platform that understands FASB standards, audit requirements, and the rigorous documentation needs of technical accounting practice.</p>

                    <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
                    <p>VeritasLogic.ai is 100% employee-owned and employee-funded. We don't have venture capitalists to report to, shareholders to impress, or debt holders and banks to keep happy. We don't have partners whose distributions we need to protect. We're 100% focused on our customersâ€”that's our mission and focus.</p>
                    <p>While our competitors fall into one of these categories, we are different. This independence allows us to make decisions based purely on what serves our customers best, not what satisfies outside financial interests.</p>
