# Privacy Hardening Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete (Log Sanitization & Temp File Audit)

---

## Phase 1: Completed Items

### 1. Log Sanitization ✅

**Created:** `shared/log_sanitizer.py`

**Purpose:** Remove PII and sensitive customer data from error logs while preserving debugging information.

**Implementation:**
- `sanitize_for_log()`: Sanitizes error messages for logging
- `sanitize_exception_for_db()`: Sanitizes exceptions for database storage

**PII Patterns Removed:**
- SSN/EIN (Social Security/Employer ID Numbers)
- Bank account numbers (6-17 digits)
- Credit card numbers (13-19 digits)
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers (various formats)
- IBAN (International Bank Account Numbers)

**Files Updated:**
- `backend_api.py`: Added import and updated 10+ critical exception handlers
  - Token refresh errors
  - Database connection errors
  - Login/authentication errors
  - Billing transaction errors
  - Stripe payment errors
  - Webhook signature errors

**Usage Example:**
```python
try:
    # Some operation
except Exception as e:
    # OLD: logger.error(f"Error: {e}")  # Could log sensitive data
    # NEW: 
    logger.error(f"Error: {sanitize_for_log(e)}")  # Sanitized
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves error type and short context for debugging
- Automatically masks SSN, account numbers, emails, etc.
- Truncates very long messages (likely contract text)
- Safe for production logs

### 2. Temp File Cleanup Audit ✅

**Audit Results:** ✅ **All Clear - No Issues Found**

**Findings:**
- All temporary file usage follows Python best practices
- Every `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` call uses context managers (`with` statements)
- Automatic cleanup guaranteed, even if exceptions occur
- No unsafe patterns detected (no `mkdtemp`, `mkstemp` without cleanup)

**Files Verified:**
- `asc606/clean_memo_generator.py`
- `asc718/clean_memo_generator.py`
- `asc842/clean_memo_generator.py`
- `asc805/clean_memo_generator.py`
- `asc340/clean_memo_generator.py`
- `shared/audit_pack_generator.py`

**Safe Pattern Used Everywhere:**
```python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp_file:
    doc.save(tmp_file.name)
    tmp_file.seek(0)
    return tmp_file.read()
# ✅ Temp file automatically deleted when exiting 'with' block
```

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Current implementation is secure.

## Phase 2: User-Handled Documentation (Pending)

### 3. Subprocessor Page
- **Status:** User will handle
- **Location:** `veritaslogic_multipage_website/features.html` (or new page)
- **Content Needed:**
  - OpenAI (AI analysis, 30-day retention, no training)
  - Postmark (transactional emails)
  - Railway (hosting infrastructure)
  - Stripe (payment processing)

### 4. Privacy Policy Updates
- **Status:** User will handle
- **Location:** `veritaslogic_multipage_website/privacy.html`
- **Updates Needed:**
  - Lines 97-98, 124: Change "data retention turned off" to accurate 30-day retention
  - Line 94: Update temp file language to be honest about temp storage during analysis

---

## Phase 3: Tabled for Future (Requires Planning)

### 5. Party Name De-identification
- **Status:** ⏸️ Tabled - Requires careful analysis
- **Issue:** Currently extract only ONE party per contract (customer OR vendor/lessor/acquirer)
- **Needs:** 
  - Extract BOTH parties from each contract
  - Replace with generic terms ("the Company", "the Customer")
  - Verify impact on analysis quality
- **Variables Used:**
  - ASC 606: `customer_name`
  - ASC 842: `entity_name` (lessee)
  - ASC 718: `entity_name` (granting company)
  - ASC 805: `customer_name` (target company)
  - ASC 340-40: `entity_name`

---

## Implementation Notes

### What's Working Well
1. ✅ Temp files already safely managed
2. ✅ Log sanitization implemented without breaking debugging
3. ✅ No customer data persisted after analysis completion
4. ✅ Error messages still useful for support/debugging

### Future Considerations
- Consider expanding sanitization to ASC step analyzers (low priority)
- Monitor for new temp file usage patterns in future features
- Wait for OpenAI Zero Data Retention (ZDR) approval before implementing de-identification

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Log Sanitization:**
   - Trigger errors with test data containing SSN, emails, account numbers
   - Check logs confirm PII is masked
   - Verify error context still useful for debugging

2. **Confirm Temp File Cleanup:**
   - Run analysis and monitor `/tmp` directory
   - Verify temp files removed after completion
   - Test crash scenario (kill process mid-analysis)
