                <h2>A Message from Our Founder</h2>
                <p>After spending 16 years in public accounting, including two years as an audit partner at Ernst & Young, I saw the same problem over and over again. Talented accountants were spending countless hours on repetitive, time-consuming research and documentation, pulling them away from high-value strategic work.</p>
                <p>The process of applying complex accounting standards like ASC 606 or ASC 842 to specific contracts and fact patterns was manual, prone to error, and inefficient. I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
                <p>Controller.cpa was born from that experience. Our mission is to combine the pattern-recognition power of artificial intelligence with the nuanced judgment of seasoned experts. We want to give you back your most valuable asset: your time. Our tools are designed to serve as your AI co-pilot, handling the 80% of analysis and documentation work, so you can focus on the 20% that truly requires your strategic expertise.</p>
                <p>We believe in a future where technology empowers accountants, making their work more impactful and rewarding. We're just getting started, and we're excited to have you join us on this journey.</p>
