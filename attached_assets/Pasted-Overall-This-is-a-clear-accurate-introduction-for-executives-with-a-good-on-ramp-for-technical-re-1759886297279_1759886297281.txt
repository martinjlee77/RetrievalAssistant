Overall: This is a clear, accurate introduction for executives, with a good on‑ramp for technical readers. A few claims need tightening to avoid overpromising, and adding a short “deep dive” plus guardrails/governance will boost credibility with practitioners and auditors.

Must‑fix accuracy and clarity

“LLMs cannot cite authoritative sources”
Clarify: LLMs can output citations, but without retrieval they often fabricate or misattribute them. The issue is reliability and verifiability, not the mere ability to print a citation string.
“Citations naturally flow from source material”
Not automatic. You need to carry structured source metadata with each chunk, instruct the model to cite only retrieved sources, and often add a verification pass to pin‑cite paragraphs/pages. Otherwise, models can still hallucinate citations.
“Information is current”
Only if your knowledge base is kept current. RAG mitigates the model’s training cutoff, but does not guarantee freshness by itself.
“Ensuring every response can be verified”
Replace “ensuring” with “enabling,” and note prerequisites: high‑quality sources, good retrieval, and a cite‑verification step.
Accounting sources and licensing
If you reference ASC codification directly, note (or avoid implying) you store full text unless you have a license. Many vendors store metadata/quotes/excerpts and link to licensed sources.
High‑impact improvements (executive‑friendly, deeper hooks for practitioners)

Add a 1‑paragraph “How RAG differs from fine‑tuning and web search”
Fine‑tuning teaches style/patterns but doesn’t inject up‑to‑date facts; web search lacks controlled corpora and pin‑cites. RAG brings curated sources into the prompt with traceable citations.
Add a short “Verification and Guardrails” section
Practices that make RAG audit‑ready:
Cite only retrieved passages; refuse to answer if evidence is insufficient.
Provide pin‑cites (standard/section/paragraph; page for PDFs) and short quotes.
Second‑pass verification that checks each claim against retrieved text.
Hybrid search (dense + keyword/BM25) and reranking to reduce misses.
Add “Evaluation and Quality Metrics” (one short bullet list)
Retrieval: recall@k, precision@k, MRR, coverage.
Generation: faithfulness (claims supported by sources), answer relevancy, citation accuracy.
User metrics: time‑to‑answer, deferral rate (“no sufficient evidence”).
Add “Security and Compliance for Regulated Use”
Data isolation by client, encryption at rest/in transit, access controls, audit logs, redaction of PII before indexing, and controls to prevent model providers from training on customer data.
Add “Limitations and Failure Modes” with concrete technical examples
Lost‑in‑the‑middle in long contexts; chunking that splits definitions from rules; citation hallucination; prompt injection from retrieved content; out‑of‑distribution queries.
Add “When not to use RAG”
Purely procedural tasks; answers fully inside the model; extremely structured queries better handled by a database/SQL.
Suggested wording you can paste in (targeted fixes and additions)

Update the “Problem with Traditional AI” section:
“LLMs can produce fluent answers but may fabricate sources or misattribute facts. Without retrieval from trusted materials, citations are not reliably verifiable, and training data may be stale.”
In “Enter RAG” ending line:
“The Key Difference: RAG systems look up evidence before responding and cite only what they retrieved—like a skilled professional who researches first.”
In “How RAG Works: The Technical Basics,” add a Step 4:
4. Verification and Citation Formatting:
“The system validates that key claims are supported by retrieved text, formats pin‑cites (e.g., ASC 606‑10‑25‑14 or PDF page/paragraph), and refuses to answer when evidence is insufficient.”
Replace “Citations naturally flow from source material” with:
“Citations are attached from the retrieved chunks’ metadata and included in the answer; a verification pass helps prevent fabricated cites.”
Benefits section tweaks:
Accuracy: “Grounds answers in retrieved, trusted documents; reduces—does not eliminate—hallucinations.”
Currency: “Keep the knowledge base updated to reflect new guidance without retraining the model.”
Add a new mini‑section for practitioners: “Key System Choices That Drive RAG Quality”
Embeddings and vector DB: model choice and dimensionality; examples include ChromaDB, FAISS, Milvus, Elasticsearch kNN.
Chunking: paragraph‑aware splitting with overlaps to keep definitions with rules.
Hybrid retrieval: dense semantic + keyword/BM25; reranking with a cross‑encoder.
Query rewriting: expand acronyms (e.g., ‘PO’ → ‘performance obligation’), add synonyms, and decompose multi‑part questions.
Context budget: cap retrieved tokens; avoid lost‑in‑the‑middle by ordering and summarizing evidence.
Add “Guardrails for Professional Use”
Cite only retrieved sources; show quotes for critical assertions.
Abstain: return “insufficient evidence found” rather than improvise.
Source governance: curate and version authoritative content; log which versions were used.
Licensing: use licensed/authorized sources (e.g., ASC) or user‑provided content.
Add a short “Executive buyer’s checklist”
What sources are indexed? Are they licensed?
Do answers include pin‑cites and quotes?
How often is the knowledge base updated? Who curates it?
What are the measured retrieval/faithfulness metrics?
Can the system abstain when evidence is lacking?
How is client data isolated and secured?
Optional SEO/structure enhancements

Add a two‑line meta description:
“Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) makes AI cite its sources by looking up trusted documents before answering. Learn how RAG reduces hallucinations and enables audit‑ready analysis in technical accounting.”
Add a brief FAQ:
What’s the difference between RAG and fine‑tuning?
Does RAG eliminate hallucinations?
Which vector databases are used in RAG?
How are citations verified and formatted?
Add a 3–4 sentence “How we implement RAG at VeritasLogic” box (optional, tie to your platform):
“We use paragraph‑aware chunking with overlap, hybrid search (semantic + keyword), and a two‑pass citation process that produces paragraph‑level pin‑cites. Answers include quotes and abstain when evidence is insufficient. Knowledge bases are versioned by standard (ASC 606/842/718/805) and updated as guidance evolves.”
