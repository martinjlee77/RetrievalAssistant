ACCOUNTING POLICY MEMORANDUM
TO: Chief Accounting Officer
FROM: Technical Accounting Team
DATE: August 12, 2025
RE: Sales Comm 01
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This memorandum outlines the accounting policy for recognizing and amortizing sales commissions under ASC 340-40 at VeritasLogic. The policy applies to sales commissions calculated as 5% of the Total Contract Value (TCV) for new customer contracts. These commissions are incremental costs of obtaining a contract and should be capitalized and amortized over the contract term. This approach ensures compliance with ASC 340-40 and aligns with the company's financial reporting objectives.

SCOPE ASSESSMENT
The 5% sales commission outlined in the FY2024 Sales Commission Plan is within the scope of ASC 340-40. According to the plan, "The commission for a Commissionable Event is calculated as a flat rate of 5% of the Total Contract Value (TCV)." A "Commissionable Event" is defined as a fully executed customer contract for a new logo acquisition. As per ASC 340-40-25-2, these are incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract, as they are contingent upon the execution of a customer contract. Therefore, the 5% sales commission qualifies as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract under ASC 340-40.
COST CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK
The sales commission at 5% of TCV is classified as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. The commission is directly attributable to securing the contract, as specified in the FY2024 Sales Commission Plan: "All commissions earned under this Plan will be processed and paid within ninety (90) days following the end of the calendar month in which the Commissionable Event occurred." This aligns with ASC 340-40's guidance on capitalizing costs expected to be recovered. Consequently, these costs should be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, typically the contract term or a standard amortization period of 36 months.
MEASUREMENT & AMORTIZATION POLICY
The commission is calculated as 5% of the TCV, which includes recurring software fees, one-time license fees, and professional services fees, but excludes taxes, third-party costs, and hardware. According to ASC 340-40-35-1, the asset recognized should be amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Commissions will be amortized over the initial contract term, aligning with the transfer of goods or services and the recognition of related revenue. The amortization will commence in the month following the Commissionable Event and continue systematically over the contract term.
ILLUSTRATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT
For a Total Contract Value (TCV) of $100,000, the commission is calculated as $100,000 * 5% = $5,000. This commission cost is capitalized as an asset and amortized over 36 months. The journal entry to record the capitalization is:
Debit "Contract Cost Asset" $5,000
Credit "Cash/Accounts Payable" $5,000
The monthly amortization expense is:
Debit "Amortization Expense" $138.89
Credit "Contract Cost Asset" $138.89
Thus, a $100,000 sale results in a $5,000 commission cost being capitalized and amortized over 36 months, impacting both the balance sheet and income statement with an amortization expense of $138.89 per month.
CONCLUSION
The policy framework for sales commissions at VeritasLogic ensures compliance with ASC 340-40 by capitalizing and amortizing commission costs over the expected period of benefit. This approach aligns with the contract terms specifying a 5% commission rate on the TCV and ensures accurate financial statement presentation. The policy should be consistently applied to all relevant contracts to maintain uniformity in financial reporting.
