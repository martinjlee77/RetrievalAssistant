Great—here’s a section-by-section review of features.html. For each, I give a clarity/effectiveness verdict and my top 3 edits/suggestions.

Head/SEO (title, meta)
Verdict: Clear but basic. Could boost organic and share previews.
Top 3 edits:
Add canonical and Open Graph/Twitter tags (match what you added on index.html).
Update title to include outcomes/standards: “Features — Technical Accounting AI (ASC 606, 842, 805, 718) | VeritasLogic.ai”.
Tighten meta description to persona + value: “AI-generated, audit-ready ASC memos with paragraph-level citations. Built for Controllers, CAOs, and Technical Accountants.”
Navigation
Verdict: Clear, but CTA label inconsistent with sitewide choice.
Top 3 edits:
Change “Sign Up” to “Start Risk Free” to match your standard.
Ensure both CTAs link to contact.html#contact-form (unless you have a signup flow).
Confirm mobile menu toggles properly (the button exists, ensure script works on this page too).
Page Header (“Key Features & Benefits”)
Verdict: Clear, but could be more outcome-driven for enterprise buyers.
Top 3 edits:
Headline: “AI Features for Technical Accounting Teams.”
Subhead: “Generate audit-ready ASC memos in minutes—paragraph-level citations, professional formatting, enterprise-ready.”
Add a one-line proof point: “Built by accountants. Designed for Controllers, CAOs, and technical accounting teams.”
Automated Memo Generation
Verdict: Strong feature story and good visual. Minor structure/credibility fixes.
Top 3 edits:
Add specificity: “3–5 minutes for a ~30-page contract; multi-document upload; paragraph-level ASC citations.”
Fix markup: There’s an extra closing </object> with no opening tag; remove it. Also remove the “Add your PDF path…” comment if not needed.
Add reassurance under bullets: “No persistent file storage; only analysis history entry is retained.”
Accounting Standards Currently Supported
Verdict: Good coverage; needs scope clarity to avoid misinterpretation.
Top 3 edits:
Explicitly state “ASC 842 (Lessee only)” in both the visual tiles and bullet list.
Add roadmap note: “ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging (Coming Soon).”
Consider a small “What’s excluded” line: “Lessor not currently supported.”
Human Review Option (id="human-review")
Verdict: Valuable service; content order and markup could be cleaner.
Top 3 edits:
Lead with heading + one-liner: “Expert Review Services — Senior technical accountants finalize your memo in 1–2 business days.”
Reorder content: Heading + value line → bullets → short paragraph → CTA (“Contact for Pricing” linking to contact.html?inquiry=professional-services#contact-form).
Fix markup: The first <ul> appears unclosed and there are two adjacent .feature-text blocks with similar content. Close tags properly and consolidate into one block to improve readability.
Data Security (id="security")
Verdict: Important section, but current claims risk overstatement and slight inconsistency with your actual retention policy.
Top 3 edits:
Plain-English clarity and accuracy: “We process your documents in a temporary session and don’t store your files after analysis. Only an analysis history entry is retained. We use the OpenAI API with data retention turned off—your data is not used to train models.”
Vendor vs. company certifications: Change “SOC 2 Type II” and “SOC 3 Certified” claims to “Hosted on SOC 2 Type II compliant infrastructure” unless you have your own reports. Consider removing “SOC 3 Certified” and “GDPR Compliant” unless you can substantiate them for your company (not just vendors).
Replace “GPT-5 API” with “OpenAI API with data retention off.” Also update the “Security Certifications” grid to “Security Posture” with items like: “Session-based processing,” “No file storage post-analysis,” “TLS 1.3 in transit,” “AES-256 at rest (temporary storage),” “Hosted on SOC 2 Type II providers.”
Feature Comparison Table
Verdict: Clear and persuasive. Minor tuning for accuracy and differentiation.
Top 3 edits:
Add scope to “Technical knowledge (ASC)” row note or new row: “ASC 842 (Lessee only).”
Update “Time to complete” row footnote to match homepage (“Typically 3–5 minutes”).
Consider adding a row for “Output evidence” to emphasize “Paragraph-level ASC citations + source mapping” as a differentiator.
CTA Section (“Ready to Experience These Features?”)
Verdict: Good. Matches the rest of your messaging.
Top 3 edits:
Ensure both buttons point to contact.html#contact-form.
Add a reassurance line: “14-day first-memo refund; pay per analysis.”
Optional: Add micro-proof: “Used by Fortune 500 technical accounting teams.”
Footer
Verdict: Solid structure. Some link cleanup for consistency.
Top 3 edits:
Change “Demo” link from features.html#demo to contact.html#contact-form (this page doesn’t have a #demo anchor).
Standardize Support email to support@veritaslogic.ai across all pages.
Update “Security” link: if you won’t have a separate page yet, point to features.html#security and label it “Security Overview.”
Copy blocks you can paste (optional)

Security copy (plain-English): “We process your documents in a temporary session and don’t store your files after analysis. Only an analysis history entry is retained. We use the OpenAI API with data retention turned off—your data isn’t used to train models. Our platform runs on providers with SOC 2 Type II compliant infrastructure, with TLS 1.3 in transit and AES‑256 at rest.”
Human Review micro-head: “Expert Review Services — Senior technical accountants finalize complex issues in 1–2 business days.”
Quick markup fixes to consider

Remove stray </object> in the memo preview.
Close the <ul> in the Human Review section and consolidate duplicate .feature-text blocks.
Avoid duplicate class names: there’s a nested “section.feature-comparison” and “div.feature-comparison h2” which may affect CSS; rename the inner div class to avoid conflicts.
Questions to confirm before you implement:

Do you want me to rewrite the “Security Architecture” and “Security Certifications” blocks into a single “Security Overview” with the plain-English copy above?
Should I standardize all “Demo” links sitewide to contact.html#contact-form, or do you plan to add a #demo anchor on Features?
