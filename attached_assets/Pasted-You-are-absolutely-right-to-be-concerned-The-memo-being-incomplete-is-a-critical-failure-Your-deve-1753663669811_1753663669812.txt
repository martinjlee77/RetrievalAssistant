You are absolutely right to be concerned. The memo being incomplete is a critical failure. Your developer has correctly identified the symptom and has attempted logical fixes, but the root cause of the problem is more fundamental and architectural.

Let's break down exactly what is happening, why the current fixes aren't working, and what the correct, production-ready solution is.

Diagnosis of the Problem: Why the Memo is Incomplete
The developer's fixes—increasing max_tokens to 16,000, upgrading the model to gpt-4o, and adding the instruction "DO NOT STOP AT STEP 2"—are common reactions to this problem. However, they fail to address the two underlying root causes:

Root Cause #1 (The Hard Limit): max_tokens is Not Respected by the API

The OpenAI API for models like gpt-4o does not support a max_tokens (output size) of 16,000. The maximum output is capped at a lower number, typically 4,096 tokens.
When you send a request with max_tokens=16000, the API doesn't throw an error. It silently accepts the request but will truncate the response as soon as it hits its internal limit of 4,096 tokens.
This is the primary reason the memo is being cut off. The model is generating the full text, but the API is physically cutting the response short before sending it back.
Root Cause #2 (The Architectural Flaw): Inefficient and Unreliable Prompting

The current get_final_memo_generation_prompt takes five large, detailed JSON objects, combines them into one enormous input prompt (potentially 10,000+ tokens), and then asks the AI to re-read, re-process, and re-write all of that information into a single output.
This is a highly inefficient and unreliable task for an LLM. It's like handing an intern five detailed reports and asking them to retype everything into a single Word document. They are likely to get tired, lose focus, and make mistakes or stop partway through.
The instruction "DO NOT STOP AT STEP 2" is a form of "prompt begging." It's a weak defense against the model's natural tendency to stop when it detects a repetitive pattern that it believes is complete.
In summary, the memo is being truncated by a hard API limit, and the underlying prompt architecture makes the model prone to stopping early anyway.

The Production-Ready Solution: Python-Driven Memo Assembly
The core principle of a robust AI system is to use the LLM for what it's best at (reasoning and generating creative prose) and use code for what it's best at (structuring, looping, and assembling).

We must stop asking the LLM to be a "document assembler." That's Python's job.

The new architecture should be a Memo Assembly Loop driven by your asc606_analyzer.py file.

The New Workflow:

The 5-step analysis loop that generates the detailed JSON for each step is perfect. Keep it exactly as is.
After the loop, instead of one giant make_llm_call for the memo, we will create the memo piece by piece in Python.
The Python code will define the final memo's structure and then call the LLM with small, highly-focused tasks to generate the prose for each section.
Here is how you would modify asc606_analyzer.py:

# In asc606_analyzer.py

# ... (The 5-step analysis loop remains the same) ...

# CRITICAL UX IMPROVEMENT: Check for failures and halt if any occurred
if failed_steps:
    # ... (This logic is perfect, keep it) ...

# === STEP 3: RE-ARCHITECTED MEMO GENERATION (Python-Driven Assembly) ===
self.logger.info("Assembling final comprehensive memo section by section...")

# Get the step results
s1, s2, s3, s4, s5 = [step_results.get(f"step_{i}", {}) for i in range(1, 6)]

# 1. Generate the Executive Summary
summary_prompt = StepAnalysisPrompts.get_summary_generation_prompt(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5)
executive_summary = make_llm_call(self.client, summary_prompt, model='gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=1000)

# 2. Generate the Background section
background_prompt = StepAnalysisPrompts.get_background_generation_prompt(contract_data)
background = make_llm_call(self.client, background_prompt, model='gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=500)

# 3. Assemble the Detailed Analysis by formatting the existing JSON (NO NEW LLM CALLS NEEDED HERE)
# This part is just Python string formatting, which is fast and reliable.
detailed_analysis_sections = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    step_data = step_results.get(f"step_{i}", {})
    # Use a helper function to format the rich JSON into markdown text
    formatted_step = StepAnalysisPrompts.format_step_detail_as_markdown(step_data)
    detailed_analysis_sections.append(formatted_step)
detailed_analysis_prose = "\n\n".join(detailed_analysis_sections)

# 4. Generate other prose-heavy sections
key_judgments_prompt = StepAnalysisPrompts.get_key_judgments_generation_prompt(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5)
key_judgments = make_llm_call(self.client, key_judgments_prompt, model='gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=1000)
# (Repeat for Financial Impact, Conclusion, etc.)

# 5. Assemble the final memo in Python
final_memo_parts = [
    f"## Executive Summary\n{executive_summary}",
    f"## Background\n{background}",
    f"## Detailed Analysis\n{detailed_analysis_prose}",
    f"## Key Judgments\n{key_judgments}",
    # ... etc.
]
final_memo = "\n\n---\n\n".join(final_memo_parts)

self.logger.info(f"Final memo assembled: {len(final_memo)} characters")

# === STEP 4: RETURN CLEAN, CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS RESULT ===
# ... (the rest of your logic is correct)

New Prompts Needed in step_prompts.py
This new architecture requires breaking down the monolithic get_final_memo_generation_prompt into smaller, specialist prompts.

Example: A new format_step_detail_as_markdown helper function (in Python, not an LLM call):

# In step_prompts.py

@staticmethod
def format_step_detail_as_markdown(step_data: dict) -> str:
    """Formats the rich JSON of a single step into professional markdown prose."""
    parts = []
    parts.append(f"### {step_data.get('step_name', 'Unknown Step')}")
    parts.append(f"**Conclusion:** {step_data.get('executive_conclusion', 'N/A')}")
    parts.append("\n**Detailed Analysis & Reasoning:**")
    parts.append(step_data.get('detailed_analysis', 'N/A'))

    parts.append("\n**Supporting Contract Evidence:**")
    for evidence in step_data.get('supporting_contract_evidence', []):
        parts.append(f"> [QUOTE]{evidence.get('quote', '')}[/QUOTE]\n> **Analysis:** {evidence.get('analysis', '')}")

    parts.append("\n**Authoritative Guidance:**")
    for citation in step_data.get('asc_606_citations', []):
        parts.append(f"- **[CITATION]{citation.get('paragraph', '')}:** *{citation.get('full_text', '')}*\n  - **Relevance:** {citation.get('relevance', '')}")

    return "\n".join(parts)

Example: A new get_summary_generation_prompt:

# In step_prompts.py

@staticmethod
def get_summary_generation_prompt(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5) -> str:
    """Generates just the executive summary."""
    return f"""
    Based on the following conclusions from a 5-step ASC 606 analysis, write a concise, professional executive summary for a technical memo.

    - Step 1 Conclusion: {s1.get('executive_conclusion')}
    - Step 2 Conclusion: {s2.get('executive_conclusion')}
    - Step 3 Conclusion: {s3.get('executive_conclusion')}
    - Step 4 Conclusion: {s4.get('executive_conclusion')}
    - Step 5 Conclusion: {s5.get('executive_conclusion')}

    Synthesize these points into a single, cohesive summary paragraph.
    """

Conclusion and Final Recommendation
The current approach is fundamentally broken due to API limits and an unreliable prompt strategy. Simply increasing tokens will not work.

The Python-Driven Memo Assembly Loop is the correct, professional solution. It is:

Reliable: It is not subject to LLM "laziness" or API token limits for the final output size. The final memo can be of any length.
More Controllable: You have perfect control over the final structure and formatting.
Easier to Debug: If one section is weak (e.g., the summary), you only need to fix that one small prompt, not the entire monolithic one.
More Efficient: It uses smaller, faster, and cheaper LLM calls for each specific prose-generation task.
You should work with your developer to refactor the final memo generation stage in asc606_analyzer.py to use this new, more robust assembly loop architecture. This will permanently solve the incomplete memo problem.
