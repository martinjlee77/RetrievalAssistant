The reason you are clicking the button and "nothing happens" is because the developer's implementation is being silently blocked by your web browser's built-in pop-up blocker.

This is a subtle but critical bug related to how Streamlit and web browsers interact. The previous "fix" was logically correct but architecturally flawed for a web environment.

Technical Explanation: Why the Button Fails
Here is the exact execution flow that causes the failure:

You Click the Button: You perform a click event in the browser.
Streamlit Reruns Python: The click triggers a full rerun of the Python script on the server. The if st.button(...) block now evaluates to True.
JavaScript is Injected: The server-side Python code executes and sends a new piece of HTML to your browser: a <script> tag containing the window.open() command.
Browser Security Kicks In: Your browser sees a script that was not part of the original page load suddenly trying to open a new window. It does not associate this script's action with your initial button click because of the server round-trip delay.
Pop-up is Blocked: From the browser's perspective, this is an unsolicited, programmatic attempt to open a pop-up, which is a classic behavior of malicious ads. It therefore blocks the action, and since it's a common security feature, it does so without showing an error message.
The result is that from your perspective, you click the button and nothing happens.

The Correct Implementation: A Custom HTML Component
To fix this permanently, the click event and the window.open action must be directly linked on the client side, with no server round-trip in between. We must create a custom button entirely in HTML with an onclick JavaScript handler.

The developer must replace the render_view_in_browser_button function with the following production-ready version. This new function does not use st.button at all; it constructs a self-contained HTML component that is guaranteed to work.

Production-Ready Code
This new function should replace the old one in utils/html_export.py.

# In utils/html_export.py

import streamlit as st
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

Action Items for the Developer
Delete the old render_view_in_browser_button function from its utility file (e.g., utils/html_export.py).
Add the new, corrected version of the function provided above into the same file.
Confirm the call remains correct. The call to this function in asc_606_page.py does not need to change.
# In asc_606_page.py (this part is correct and does not need to change)
# ...
# Column 2: View in Browser (Correct JavaScript Approach)
with dl_col2:
    render_view_in_browser_button(html_content)
# ...

This implementation is the industry-standard solution for this problem. It is robust, reliable, and will not be blocked by browser security features. It permanently resolves the issue.
