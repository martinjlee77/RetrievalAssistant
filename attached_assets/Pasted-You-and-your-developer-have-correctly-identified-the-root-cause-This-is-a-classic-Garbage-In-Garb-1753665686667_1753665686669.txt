You and your developer have correctly identified the root cause. This is a classic "Garbage In, Garbage Out" problem, but with a subtle twist. The problem is not with the Python assembly code (format_step_detail_as_markdown), but with the quality of the data being fed into it.

The developer's diagnosis is spot on: the malformed text like T h e p r i m a r y j u d g m e n t... is coming directly from the LLM during the step-by-step analysis phase. The Python formatter is just faithfully (and correctly) reproducing the bad data it receives.

This is a known, albeit infrequent, issue with large language models, especially when they are asked to generate large, complex JSON objects. It can be caused by a combination of factors, including API streaming artifacts, subtle temperature setting effects, or the model struggling with complex nested structures under pressure.

Your developer's attempts to fix it in the formatting function were logical but were aimed at the symptom, not the cause. We need to fix the source.

Here is the detailed feedback and a robust, multi-layered solution to provide your developer.

The Problem: LLM JSON Generation is Unreliable Under Duress
When we force the LLM to return a large, complex, multi-level nested JSON object (like the one in get_step_specific_analysis_prompt), we are pushing it to the edge of its capabilities. This increases the chance of it producing malformed outputs, such as:

Character Spacing: The T h i s i s a n i s s u e problem.
Truncated Strings: A string that just ends mid-sentence.
Invalid JSON: Missing commas, brackets, or quotes that cause the json.loads() to fail.
The current prompts are excellent at instructing the AI, but we need to make the output structure more resilient.

The Solution: A Two-Pronged Approach
We will attack this problem from both ends: (1) Simplify the AI's task to reduce the chance of errors, and (2) Add a "sanitization" layer in our Python code to catch and fix any errors that still slip through.

Prong 1: Simplify the JSON Structure in step_prompts.py (The Proactive Fix)
The most complex part of our current JSON is the nested lists of dictionaries for citations and evidence. This is a common point of failure. We can simplify this structure significantly without losing any information.

Current (Complex) JSON Structure:

"asc_606_citations": [
  {
    "paragraph": "...",
    "full_text": "...",
    "relevance": "..."
  }
]

Proposed (Simpler & More Robust) JSON Structure: Let's ask the AI to return simple lists of strings, with a consistent separator character that our Python code can parse. The pipe | character is excellent for this.

Revised Prompt in get_step_specific_analysis_prompt:

# In step_prompts.py, inside get_step_specific_analysis_prompt, update the JSON structure block:

# ... (rest of the prompt is fine) ...
Return your response as a single, valid JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "executive_conclusion": "One comprehensive sentence...",
  "detailed_analysis": "Your thorough, multi-paragraph analysis...",

  "asc_606_citations": [
    "ASC 606-XX-XX-X | Full text of the ASC 606 paragraph | Explanation of how this guidance applies"
  ],

  "ey_guidance_citations": [
    "EY Publication/Section reference | Full relevant text from EY guidance | Explanation of how this EY interpretation applies"
  ],

  "supporting_contract_evidence": [
    "Direct quote from contract | Detailed explanation of what this contract language means"
  ],

  "professional_judgments": [
    "A string explaining a single professional judgment.",
    "Another string for a second judgment."
  ],

  "potential_issues_addressed": "A single string or paragraph discussing potential issues."
}}

Why this is better:

Reduces AI Cognitive Load: The AI no longer has to worry about perfectly formatting nested dictionaries with specific keys. It just has to create a simple list of formatted strings. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and weird formatting artifacts.
Easier to Parse: Our Python code can now reliably split these strings by the | character.
Prong 2: Add a "Sanitization" Layer in Python (The Reactive Fix)
Even with a simpler prompt, the AI might occasionally produce errors. We need a robust "sanitization" function in asc606_analyzer.py that cleans the JSON before it gets stored or formatted.

This new function will perform two tasks:

Recursively loop through the entire JSON object from the LLM.
For every string value, it will fix common formatting errors.
New Sanitization Function in asc606_analyzer.py:

# In asc606_analyzer.py, add this new helper function inside the class

def _sanitize_llm_json(self, data: Any) -> Any:
    """
    Recursively traverses a JSON object from the LLM and cleans up
    common string formatting issues like character splitting.
    """
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        return {key: self._sanitize_llm_json(value) for key, value in data.items()}
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        return [self._sanitize_llm_json(item) for item in data]
    elif isinstance(data, str):
        # 1. Fix the "s p a c e d o u t" text issue
        # This regex finds single characters separated by one or more spaces
        # and joins them back together.
        sanitized_str = re.sub(r'\b(\w)\s(?=\w\b)', r'\1', data)

        # 2. Collapse multiple spaces into a single space
        sanitized_str = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', sanitized_str).strip()

        return sanitized_str
    else:
        return data

# Then, use this function immediately after receiving the JSON response:

# In the `for step_num in range(1, 6):` loop in `analyze_contract`:

try:
    step_response = make_llm_call(...)
    step_analysis_raw = json.loads(step_response)

    # --- THIS IS THE NEW SANITIZATION STEP ---
    step_analysis_sanitized = self._sanitize_llm_json(step_analysis_raw)

    step_results[f"step_{step_num}"] = step_analysis_sanitized
    self.logger.info(...)
except (...):
    # ...

This creates a defensive layer. The simpler prompt (Prong 1) will prevent most errors, and this sanitization function (Prong 2) will catch and fix any that still occur.

Finally, we need to update the format_step_detail_as_markdown function in step_prompts.py to handle the new, simpler list-of-strings format.

Revised format_step_detail_as_markdown in step_prompts.py:

# In step_prompts.py

@staticmethod
def format_step_detail_as_markdown(step_data: dict, step_num: int, step_name: str) -> str:
    # ... (header and detailed_analysis parts are fine) ...

    # Supporting contract evidence (now parsing the simple string list)
    if step_data.get('supporting_contract_evidence'):
        parts.append("\n**Supporting Contract Evidence:**")
        for evidence_str in step_data.get('supporting_contract_evidence', []):
            evidence_parts = evidence_str.split('|', 1) # Split only once
            quote = evidence_parts[0].strip()
            analysis = evidence_parts[1].strip() if len(evidence_parts) > 1 else ""
            if quote:
                parts.append(f"> [QUOTE]{quote}[/QUOTE]")
            if analysis:
                parts.append(f"> **Analysis:** {analysis}")

    # ASC 606 Citations (now parsing the simple string list)
    if step_data.get('asc_606_citations'):
        parts.append("\n**Authoritative Guidance:**")
        for citation_str in step_data.get('asc_606_citations', []):
            citation_parts = citation_str.split('|', 2) # Split max twice
            paragraph = citation_parts[0].strip()
            full_text = citation_parts[1].strip() if len(citation_parts) > 1 else ""
            relevance = citation_parts[2].strip() if len(citation_parts) > 2 else ""
            if paragraph and full_text:
                parts.append(f"- **[CITATION]{paragraph}:** *{full_text}*")
            if relevance:
                 parts.append(f"  - **Relevance:** {relevance}")

    # ... (and so on for other list-based fields) ...

    return "\n".join(parts)

Summary of Feedback for Your Developer
"You've correctly diagnosed that the formatting issues originate from the LLM's step-analysis responses, not the Python assembly code. This is a common challenge with complex JSON generation.

To solve this permanently, let's implement a robust, two-pronged strategy:

Proactive Fix (Simplify the Prompt): Let's refactor the JSON structure in the get_step_specific_analysis_prompt in step_prompts.py. Instead of asking for nested dictionaries for citations and evidence, let's have it return simple lists of strings, with fields separated by a pipe | character. This reduces the cognitive load on the AI and makes errors less likely.

Reactive Fix (Add a Sanitization Layer): In asc606_analyzer.py, let's create a new _sanitize_llm_json helper function. This function will recursively traverse the JSON response from the LLM and use regex to clean up any common formatting errors, like the character-splitting issue. We will call this function immediately after json.loads() for each step.

Finally, we'll need to update the format_step_detail_as_markdown function to parse the new, simpler list[str] format instead of the old list[dict] format.

This multi-layered approach will prevent the majority of formatting errors at the source and automatically correct any that still slip through, making our entire pipeline much more resilient."â–Œ
