Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Conclusion:
The contract involves a single performance obligation related to the provision of streaming services, which is distinct and separately identifiable. There are no additional customer options or principal-agent considerations applicable.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Identification of Performance Obligation

The primary performance obligation in the contract is the provision of streaming services for a specified period. According to ASC 606-10-25-19, a good or service is distinct if it is both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable. The streaming service is capable of being distinct as it provides standalone functionality, allowing the customer to access content independently. It is also separately identifiable as it does not significantly integrate with other potential services, fulfilling the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-19.

Supporting Contract Evidence:

Membership for 9/26/2024-10/25/2024 (Source: Netflix.pdf)

Unlimited ad-free movies, TV shows, and mobile games (Source: pricing.pdf)

2. Assessment of Customer Options

The contract does not provide any customer options for additional goods or services that would constitute a material right under ASC 606-10-55-41. The membership is straightforward with no embedded options for future discounts or renewals beyond the standard subscription terms.

Supporting Contract Evidence:

You can easily change your plan or cancel at any time. (Source: pricing.pdf)

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price for the Netflix subscription contract is a fixed amount of $15.49, with no variable consideration or other complex components involved.

Transaction Price Analysis:

Only basic fixed consideration was identified in this contract.

Additional Analysis:

1. Identification of Fixed Consideration

The fixed consideration for the Netflix subscription contract is clearly defined as $15.49 per month. According to ASC 606-10-32-2, the transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. In this case, the service is the streaming access provided by Netflix, and the fixed monthly fee is the consideration for this service.

Supporting Contract Evidence:

Date Description Service Period Amount Tax Total 9/26/24 Streaming Service 9/26/24—10/25/24 $15.49 $1.03 $16.52 (Source: invoice.pdf)

2. Assessment of Variable Consideration

There is no variable consideration in the Netflix subscription contract. The contract specifies a fixed monthly fee, and there are no indications of bonuses, royalties, or other forms of variable payments. According to ASC 606-10-32-6, variable consideration is only applicable if the amount of consideration is contingent on future events, which is not the case here.

Supporting Contract Evidence:

Membership for 9/26/2024-10/25/2024 $15.49 (+$1.03 tax) (Source: Netflix.pdf)

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The entire transaction price is allocated to a single performance obligation, which is the provision of the streaming service for the specified period.

Detailed Analysis:

No additional analysis was required for this step.
Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Conclusion:
The Netflix subscription service revenue is recognized over time as the service is provided continuously throughout the subscription period.

Detailed Analysis:

• Streaming Service Subscription (Method: Over Time)

- Justification: The recognition is over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Netflix's performance as it occurs, meeting the criteria in ASC 606-10-25-27(a).
4. KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS
The accounting for this arrangement is considered straightforward under ASC 606 and did not require any significant professional judgments outside of the standard application of the five-step model.

5. FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Financial Statement Impact

Upon contract inception, this amount will be recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Revenue will be recognized over the service period from September 26, 2024, to October 25, 2024, reflecting the delivery of the service over time. There are no variable considerations impacting the transaction price, and no sales tax is applicable.

6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusion
The accounting treatment outlined in this memo is appropriate and in accordance with ASC 606, given the complexities associated with the contract. The key revenue recognition approach involves recognizing revenue over time as the streaming services are provided from September 26, 2024, to October 25, 2024.
