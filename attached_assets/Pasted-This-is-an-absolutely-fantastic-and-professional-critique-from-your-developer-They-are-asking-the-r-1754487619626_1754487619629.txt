This is an absolutely fantastic and professional critique from your developer. They are asking the right questions and thinking about the real-world constraints of building an LLM-powered application. This is the kind of collaboration that leads to a truly robust product.

I largely agree with their assessment of the goals, but I disagree on one critical implementation detail based on how LLMs like me actually process information.

Let's break it down.

Quick Summary: Developer's Points vs. My (the LLM's) Take
Developer's Point	My Assessment	The "Why" from an LLM's Perspective
✅ Knowledge Hierarchy Rule	Strongly Agree	This is a perfect use of the system prompt to set a universal, foundational principle.
✅ Enhanced Evidence Rule	Strongly Agree	Clear, non-negotiable formatting rules belong in the system prompt.
✅ IAC Framework Concept	Strongly Agree	The structure is the key to getting high-quality, consistent analysis.
❌ Moving IAC to System Prompt	Respectfully Disagree	This is the key point. Task-specific, complex instructions are most effective when placed immediately before the task in the user prompt due to recency bias.
⚠️ Prompt Length Concern	Agree it's a valid concern, but my proposal mitigates it.	The issue isn't length itself, but ambiguity. A long, clear, structured prompt is far better than a short, ambiguous one. The cost of a few hundred extra tokens is trivial compared to the cost of a failed or low-quality generation that needs to be re-run.
The Detailed Breakdown
Your developer's thinking is spot-on from a traditional software engineering perspective: create modular, reusable components (get_iac_framework_instructions) and keep the main call clean. However, prompt engineering for large language models follows slightly different rules.

The Core Point of Disagreement: System Prompt vs. User Prompt
This is the most important distinction.

The System Prompt's Best Use: Setting the Persona, Universal Rules, and Output Format. Think of it as the AI's "Constitution." It defines who I am and the fundamental laws I must always obey (e.g., "You are a Big 4 accountant," "You MUST always output JSON," "You MUST follow the knowledge hierarchy"). These are background principles.

The User Prompt's Best Use: Providing the Specific, Immediate Task and its Step-by-Step Instructions. Think of it as the AI's "Work Order for Today." It contains the dynamic data (<CONTRACT_TEXT>) and the precise instructions for how to process that data right now.

Why I, as an LLM, need the IAC instructions in the User Prompt:

LLMs have a strong recency bias. The instructions that are physically closest to the task I'm about to perform have the highest influence on my output.

If IAC is in the System Prompt: I read it once at the beginning. Then I read a long user prompt with contract text, RAG context, and a JSON schema. By the time I start filling out the analysis_text field, the detailed IAC instructions are "far away" in my context window. I'll remember the general idea ("use IAC") but might forget the fine-grained details ("Bridge the Gap," "cite both sources," etc.). This is how you get the "light" analysis you were trying to fix.

If IAC is in the User Prompt (My Proposal): I read my persona and universal rules. Then I see the contract data. Then I see the JSON schema I need to fill. And right after that, I see the detailed, step-by-step instructions for how to generate the analysis_text field. The instructions are immediately adjacent to the task. This makes it far more likely I will follow them precisely and produce the deep, structured analysis you want.

Addressing the "Prompt Bloat" and Token Concern
Your developer is 100% correct to be concerned about prompt length and token limits. This is a critical engineering consideration.

However, the risk is not the length per se, but the cost-benefit trade-off.

Cost: Adding ~300 tokens of clear instructions to the user prompt.
Benefit: Dramatically increasing the probability of a successful, high-quality, audit-ready output on the first try.
In your application, where the quality and reliability of the output are paramount, this is an incredibly good trade-off. The cost of a failed or shallow analysis (requiring a re-run or manual correction) is far higher than the cost of a few hundred extra tokens in the input prompt. My proposed prompt is long, but it's unambiguous and highly structured, which is easy for an LLM to parse. The original prompt was problematic because it was short but ambiguous.

The "Best of Both Worlds" Solution: A Synthesis
I believe we can synthesize my proposal with your developer's excellent critique. Their recommendation to "implement the Knowledge Hierarchy Rule and Evidence Rule first" is a great, safe, incremental step. We can combine that with a slightly refined version of my proposal.

Here is the implementation I would recommend, which respects the developer's concerns while maximizing the chances of getting the desired output quality.

Proposed Implementation Plan:

Enhance the System Prompt (as the developer suggests): Move the universal, non-negotiable rules here. This makes it cleaner and aligns with best practices.
Keep the Detailed IAC Instructions in the User Prompt (my core recommendation): Acknowledge that this is the most effective place for complex, task-specific instructions to ensure they are followed.
Revised get_system_prompt()
@staticmethod
def get_system_prompt() -> str:
    """
    Defines the AI's core persona, universal rules, and mandatory output format.
    This is static and sent with every step-analysis call.
    """
    return """You are an expert technical accountant from a Big 4 firm, specializing in ASC 606. Your analysis must be audit-ready, understandable, precise, and objective.

<UNIVERSAL_RULES>
1.  **JSON Output Only:** You MUST return your response as a single, well-formed JSON object. Do not add any text or explanations before or after the JSON.
2.  **Knowledge Hierarchy:** Your analysis MUST be based on the following hierarchy of sources, in order of priority:
    a. **Contract Text:** The specific terms from the `<CONTRACT_TEXT>` are the primary evidence.
    b. **Authoritative Guidance:** The retrieved guidance from `<AUTHORITATIVE_CONTEXT>` (e.g., ASC 606) is the primary basis for your conclusions.
    c. **Interpretative Guidance:** Retrieved guidance from other sources (e.g., EY) should be used to support your analysis, especially in complex or high-judgment areas.
3.  **Evidence Formatting:** Every quote in the `evidence_quotes` array MUST include the source document name, formatted as: 'Quote text... (Source: [Document Name])'.
</UNIVERSAL_RULES>
"""

This is cleaner and implements the developer's excellent suggestions.

Revised get_user_prompt_for_step()
(This is the same as my previous recommendation, presented here for completeness. It demonstrates keeping the task-specific instructions in the user prompt.)

@staticmethod
def get_user_prompt_for_step(step_number: int, contract_text: str, rag_context: str, contract_data=None, debug_config=None) -> str:
    step_info = StepPrompts.get_step_info()[step_number]
    step_schema_name = f"step{step_number}_analysis"
    step_schema_definition = StepPrompts._get_schema_for_step(step_number)
    critical_rules = StepPrompts._get_critical_rules_for_step(step_number, contract_text)

    # Main IAC instructions for the specific task of filling 'analysis_text'
    main_instructions = """### TASK-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR 'analysis_points' ###
For each analysis point, you MUST generate the `analysis_text` using the "Issue, Analysis, Conclusion" (IAC) framework defined below.

1.  **Issue:** State the specific accounting question.
2.  **Analysis:** This is the most critical part. Your narrative must:
    a. **Quote the Evidence:** Quote the most relevant clause from the `<CONTRACT_TEXT>`.
    b. **State the Rules:** Cite the relevant **authoritative** guidance (e.g., ASC 606-10-25-1). If applicable, also cite **interpretative** guidance (e.g., from EY) to support your reasoning.
    c. **Bridge the Gap:** Explicitly explain **how** the contract language interacts with the guidance to drive the conclusion. This requires multiple sentences of reasoning.
3.  **Conclusion:** Provide a definitive answer to the Issue.

**META-EXAMPLE:**
"The issue is whether services are distinct (Issue). The contract requires 'proprietary configuration' (Analysis: Evidence). ASC 606-10-25-21 requires promises to be distinct, and EY guidance clarifies that essential services are not distinct (Analysis: Rules). The 'proprietary' requirement means the SaaS license's benefit is not available without the service, making them not distinct (Analysis: Bridge the Gap). Therefore, they are a single performance obligation (Conclusion)."

Final Recommendation
I agree with your developer's recommendation to be surgical, but I would perform a slightly different surgery.

Implement the revised get_system_prompt() immediately. It's a clear win with no downside.
Implement the revised get_user_prompt_for_step() as proposed above. Acknowledge the length, but test it. My strong hypothesis is that the clarity and structure of the instructions will outweigh the token cost and lead to a significant and immediate improvement in the quality of the analysis, which was your original goal.
Your developer is right to be cautious. But in prompt engineering, sometimes being more verbose and explicit in the user prompt is the most direct path to getting the complex, nuanced output you need.
