
Great—here’s a section‑by‑section review of pricing.html focused on clarity, accuracy, and conversion for Controllers/CAOs/technical accountants. I’ll note verdicts and detailed edits/suggestions.

Head/SEO (title, meta)
Verdict: Clear but can better capture pricing intent and share previews.
Suggestions:
Title: “Pricing — Pay‑Per‑Analysis Technical Accounting AI | VeritasLogic.ai”
Meta description: “Simple, per‑analysis pricing. Automatic tiering by document size. 14‑day first‑memo refund. Built for Controllers, CAOs, and Technical Accountants.”
Add Open Graph/Twitter tags (like index.html) so pricing links preview cleanly in internal chats.
Navigation
Verdict: Clear. CTA consistent.
Suggestions:
Keep “Start Risk Free” everywhere; both CTAs should link to contact.html#contact-form (unless a signup flow exists).
Ensure mobile menu JS is loaded and works on this page too.
Pricing Header (“Simple, Transparent Per‑Analysis Pricing”)
Verdict: Strong. Sets the model quickly.
Suggestions:
Add one support line for credit packs to align with your business rules: “Purchase credits in 
500
,
500,1,000, or $2,000 blocks (12‑month expiration). Credits are deducted automatically based on the tier for each analysis.”
Main Pricing Table (tiers, word counts, prices)
Verdict: Good scaffolding. Needs a few clarifications to reduce purchase anxiety.
Suggestions:
Clarify measurement method: “Document size is calculated by combined word count across all uploaded files.” Add a tooltip or footnote.
Be consistent with units:
Keep “words” as the official measure; “~pages” stays as an estimate.
Consider adding examples by tier (e.g., “Example: MSA + SOW (~28 pages) → typically 9K tier”).
Add an estimator note/CTA: “Don’t know your word count? We’ll auto‑detect at upload. No surprises.”
Edge cases: Add a footnote for tables/images: “Tables, images, and scanned PDFs may increase processing length depending on extractable text.”
Consider offering a 30K+ custom quote rather than listing 60K, or keep 60K but add “For >60K words, contact sales.”
Minor copy fixes:
Thousands formatting in prices for readability: 
1
,
095
→
1,095→1,095 (you already have this; good).
Add currency note if relevant: “USD.”
Included in All Tiers
Verdict: Strong value articulation. A few scope clarifications to avoid future disputes.
Suggestions:
Replace “1 complimentary revision” with language consistent with your rerun policy:
“One complimentary re‑run within 14 days to correct inputs or fix extractable text issues (methodology or new scope changes may require a new analysis).”
Add standards scope: “Includes the following standards: ASC 606, 340‑40, 842 (Lessee only), 718, 805.”
Add export details: “Export to DOCX, PDF, HTML, Markdown; includes paragraph‑level ASC citations.”
Add timing: “Typical 3–5 minutes for a ~30‑page contract; larger uploads may take longer.”
Add data handling reassurance: “Session‑based processing; files are not stored after analysis. Only the analysis history entry is retained.”
Professional Services (Add‑On)
Verdict: Clear. Good positioning for enterprise buyers.
Suggestions:
Add an explicit turnaround SLA: “Typical turnaround: 1–2 business days” (already noted on Features—good to repeat here).
Add reviewer credentials microcopy: “Led by senior technical accountants (15+ years; Big 4 background).”
Link correctly to the unified form with selected inquiry: contact.html?inquiry=professional-services#contact-form.
Optional: Add “Starting at $X” if you’re ready, or keep “Contact for pricing.”
Cost Comparison
Verdict: Compelling but needs precision and a small tone‑down to maintain credibility with enterprise buyers.
Suggestions:
Fix minor grammar: “Supervision (1 hour)” not “1 hours.”
Align time claims with sitewide messaging: change “⚡ Time: 3 minutes” to “⚡ Time: 3–5 minutes.”
Clarify assumptions in a footnote so the “Save 91% and in 99% less time” claim is defensible:
“Assumptions: $150/hour blended rate; 30‑page contract (~9K words); VeritasLogic.ai 9K tier pricing; excludes optional expert review.”
Reformat the VeritasLogic.ai cost card to avoid implying you charge per sub‑step:
Show time per step, but only show one total cost line. For the intermediate lines, replace dollar amounts with “Included.”
Consider adding a third “With Expert Review” card:
“AI Draft + Expert Review (1–2 business days). Estimated total: $195 + review fee. Time: AI 3–5 min, review 1–2 days.”
FAQ
Verdict: Strong content. Add a few policy details for clarity and risk control.
Suggestions:
Billing/credits: Add one line on payment processor (if Stripe): “Payments processed by Stripe.”
Money‑back: Standardize language with homepage: “First‑memo refund upon request within 14 days if the draft is not usable for your stated purpose.” Add “Manual approval” if you want to be fully explicit.
Rerun scope: Add a Q: “What does the complimentary re‑run cover?”
Answer: “Input corrections (e.g., updated contract text, fixed extraction) or minor clarifications. New methodology, new documents, or materially expanded scope typically require a new analysis.”
Standards scope: Add a Q: “Do you support lessor accounting under ASC 842?” → “Not currently. We support Lessee only.”
Data handling: Add a Q: “Do you store my files?” → “No. We process your documents in a temporary session and don’t store files after analysis. Only an analysis history entry is retained. We use the OpenAI API with data retention turned off—your data isn’t used to train models.”
Enterprise pricing: Specify how discounts apply (e.g., “volume‑based discounts on credit packs; contact sales”).
Turnaround: Align across site: “3–5 minutes typical for 30‑page contract; larger documents may take longer.”
CTA Section (“Ready to Get Started?”)
Verdict: Clear. Good reassurance message.
Suggestions:
Keep buttons pointing to contact.html#contact-form.
Repeat key reassurance: “First‑memo refund (14 days). No subscriptions. Pay per analysis.”
Optional social proof placeholder: “Trusted by technical accountants at Fortune 500 companies.”
Footer
Verdict: Solid. Check for consistency with the rest of the site.
Suggestions:
Make sure Support email is support@veritaslogic.ai everywhere.
If “Security” is a section within Features, label as “Security Overview” and point to features.html#security.
Consider adding “Status” if you plan to use a status page later; otherwise omit.
Copy snippets you can drop in

Tier measurement note: “We auto‑detect document size by combined word count across your uploaded files. Page counts are estimates for reference only.”
Rerun policy line: “One complimentary re‑run within 14 days for input corrections or extractable text issues. Methodology changes or new scope typically require a new analysis.”
Data handling: “We process your documents in a temporary session and don’t store your files after analysis. Only your analysis history entry is retained. We use the OpenAI API with data retention turned off—your data isn’t used to train models.”
Cost comparison footnote: “Assumptions: $150/hour blended rate; 30‑page contract (~9K words); VeritasLogic.ai 9K tier pricing; excludes optional expert review.”
Structural suggestions (optional but high impact)

Add a “Credits” panel near the top:
“Buy credits” cards: 
500
,
500,1,000, $2,000 with bullets “12‑month expiration; auto‑deduct per analysis; volume discounts for enterprise.”
A micro Calculator/Estimator: let users paste text or upload a file to estimate tier (even a simple JS word counter for marketing demo value).
Add a small “What’s included in a memo?” expandable:
“Executive summary, background, analysis, conclusion; paragraph‑level ASC citations; professional formatting; export to DOCX/PDF/HTML/Markdown.”
Potential inconsistencies to clean up

Time claims: use “3–5 minutes” consistently across site.
“Start Risk Free” is the standard CTA—replace any remaining “Free Trial.”
Standards: always state “ASC 842 (Lessee only).”
Link anchors: ensure all pricing CTAs go to contact.html#contact-form.
