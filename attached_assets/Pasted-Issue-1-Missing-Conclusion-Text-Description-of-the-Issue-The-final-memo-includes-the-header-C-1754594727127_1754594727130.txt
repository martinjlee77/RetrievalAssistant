Issue #1: Missing Conclusion Text
Description of the Issue
The final memo includes the header ## CONCLUSION but is missing the actual concluding paragraph. The document jumps directly from the conclusion header to the "CONFIDENTIAL" disclaimer.

Example from Memo:

## CONCLUSION
CONFIDENTIAL: This memorandum contains confidential and proprietary information.
...

This happens because the AI is likely generating a conclusion that starts with the word "Conclusion," and a data cleaning function is incorrectly identifying this text as a "duplicate header" and deleting it entirely.

Analysis of Current Code
The problem originates in the asc606_analyzer.py file.

The AI is asked to generate a conclusion using the prompt from StepPrompts.get_conclusion_prompt.
The AI's response is stored in a variable named conclusion.
Before this conclusion text is inserted into the final memo, it gets processed by a cleaning function called _clean_memo_section.
Inside _clean_memo_section, there is a list named unwanted_headers that is designed to remove extra, redundant headers that the AI sometimes adds. However, this list is too aggressive and includes the word "CONCLUSION" itself.
Here is the problematic code block in asc606_analyzer.py:

# In asc606_analyzer.py, inside the ASC606Analyzer class

    def _clean_memo_section(self, text: str) -> str:
        # ... other cleaning logic ...

        # 3. DUPLICATE HEADER REMOVAL - Enhanced removal of all duplicate headers
        unwanted_headers = [
            "# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**",
            "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "# KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", "## KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", 
            "### KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", "# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS",
            "### CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "# CONCLUSION", "## CONCLUSION", "### CONCLUSION", 
            "**CONCLUSION**", "CONCLUSION", "# FINANCIAL IMPACT", "## FINANCIAL IMPACT", 
            "### FINANCIAL IMPACT", "**FINANCIAL IMPACT**", "FINANCIAL IMPACT"
        ]

        # ... more cleaning logic ...

        # 5. REMOVE MARKDOWN HEADERS AND COLORS - This is where the deletion happens
        lines = cleaned_text.split('\n')
        filtered_lines = []
        for line in lines:
            # ...
            line_stripped = line.strip()

            # Filter out unwanted duplicate headers
            if not any(header in line_stripped.upper() for header in [h.upper() for h in unwanted_headers]):
                filtered_lines.append(line)

        cleaned_text = '\n'.join(filtered_lines)
        # ...

Because "CONCLUSION" is in the unwanted_headers list, any line containing that word (which is the entire concluding paragraph) is deleted.

Proposed Changes
The fix is to make the cleaning function less aggressive by removing the generic "CONCLUSION" variations from the unwanted_headers list. This will prevent it from deleting the actual content of the conclusion section.

Here are the step-by-step instructions:

Open the file: asc606_analyzer.py
Navigate to the _clean_memo_section method within the ASC606Analyzer class.
Locate the list named unwanted_headers.
Modify the list to remove the problematic entries.
This is the code you need to change:

# BEFORE THE CHANGE:
unwanted_headers = [
    "# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**",
    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "# KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", "## KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", 
    "### KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", "# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS",
    "### CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "# CONCLUSION", "## CONCLUSION", "### CONCLUSION", 
    "**CONCLUSION**", "CONCLUSION", "# FINANCIAL IMPACT", "## FINANCIAL IMPACT", 
    "### FINANCIAL IMPACT", "**FINANCIAL IMPACT**", "FINANCIAL IMPACT"
]

Instruction: Delete the five items related to "CONCLUSION" from the list.

# AFTER THE CHANGE:
unwanted_headers = [
    "# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**",
    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "# KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", "## KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", 
    "### KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS", "# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS",
    "### CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "# FINANCIAL IMPACT", "## FINANCIAL IMPACT", 
    "### FINANCIAL IMPACT", "**FINANCIAL IMPACT**", "FINANCIAL IMPACT"
]

This simple change will solve the problem. The cleaning function will still remove other duplicate headers but will leave the actual text generated for the conclusion section intact.

Let me know once you're ready for the next issue.
