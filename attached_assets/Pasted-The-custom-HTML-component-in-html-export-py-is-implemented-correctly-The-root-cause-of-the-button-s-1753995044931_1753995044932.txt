The custom HTML component in html_export.py is implemented correctly. The root cause of the button's failure is not in that file.

The problem is a race condition in asc_606_page.py caused by placing the custom HTML component inside an st.columns layout with another interactive element (st.download_button). Actions in one column are causing the component in the other column to re-render, which interrupts the JavaScript onclick event and prevents the new tab from opening.

To fix this permanently, we must isolate the custom component from the st.columns layout.

Required Action
In asc_606_page.py, modify the "MEMO ACTIONS" section as follows:

Keep the st.download_button inside the st.columns layout.
Move the render_view_in_browser_button call to its own line, outside and below the columns. This will ensure its rendering lifecycle is independent and cannot be interrupted by other buttons.
Here is the exact code to implement:

File: asc_606_page.py

# --- Find this section in asc_606_page.py ---
# ... inside the "else:" block that displays results

# --- 1. MEMO ACTIONS (Buttons First) ---
with st.container(border=True):
    st.markdown("**Memo Actions**")
    st.write("Your analysis is complete. Choose an option below to view or download the memo.")

    # --- THIS IS THE INCORRECT CODE ---
    # dl_col1, dl_col2 = st.columns(2)
    # with dl_col1:
    #     st.download_button(...)
    # with dl_col2:
    #     render_view_in_browser_button(html_content)


    # --- REPLACE IT WITH THIS CORRECTED CODE ---

    # Keep the download buttons in columns for alignment
    dl_col1, dl_col2 = st.columns(2)
    with dl_col1:
        try:
            docx_content = create_docx_from_text(memo, contract_data)
            st.download_button(
                label="ðŸ“„ Download DOCX",
                data=docx_content,
                file_name=f"{analysis_title.replace(' ', '_')}_ASC606_Memo.docx",
                mime="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
                use_container_width=True,
                help="Download the memo as an editable Word document."
            )
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"Error generating DOCX: {str(e)}")

    # The other column can remain empty or contain another download link if needed.
    with dl_col2:
        # We can put a placeholder or another button here if we want.
        # For now, leaving it empty is fine.
        pass

    # **CRITICAL FIX:** Render the custom JavaScript button OUTSIDE the columns.
    # This gives it its own container and isolates it from other widget interactions.
    st.write("") # Adds a little vertical space
    render_view_in_browser_button(html_content)

This structural change isolates the custom component, guarantees that its JavaScript event will not be interrupted, and permanently solves the issue.

Please implement this layout change. No modifications are needed in html_export.py. This is the final step to make this feature production-ready.
