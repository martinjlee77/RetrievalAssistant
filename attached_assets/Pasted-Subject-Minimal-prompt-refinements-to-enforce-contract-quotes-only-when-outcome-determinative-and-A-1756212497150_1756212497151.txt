Subject: Minimal prompt refinements to enforce contract quotes only when outcome‑determinative and ASC 606 paraphrase with pinpoint citations

Hi [Developer Name],

Per your guidance to keep the architecture simple and avoid threading new parameters or adding UI, here are minimal, copy‑paste prompt edits that implement the desired behavior:

Contract text: allow quotes when outcome‑determinative.
ASC 606: always paraphrased with pinpoint citations; brief decisive phrases only (no long verbatim quotes in any mode).
No new function signatures, no UI changes, no appendices.

Scope of changes

Only edit text in ASC606StepAnalyzer._get_step_markdown_prompt() to remove the rigid “MUST include direct quotes” language and to clarify ASC 606 treatment.
Optional micro-tweak to _get_markdown_system_prompt() to align wording. If you prefer zero changes there, the updated step prompt is sufficient to govern behavior.
Step prompt: replace two blocks A. Replace the bracketed line under the section header (immediately after “### {step['title']}”) with this:
[Write comprehensive analysis in flowing paragraphs with professional reasoning. Include specific contract evidence and ASC 606 citations. Quote contract language only when the exact wording is outcome‑determinative; paraphrase ASC 606 with pinpoint citations and use only brief decisive phrases when directly supportive.]

B. Replace the current “MUST include” Analysis block with this:

Analysis: [Detailed analysis with supporting evidence. Include:

Contract evidence with direct quotes only when specific terms drive the conclusion (use "quotation marks" and bracketed pinpoint citations).
ASC 606 guidance paraphrased with citations; include only brief decisive phrases when directly supportive (e.g., cite as: [ASC 606-10-25-19]).
Explicit reasoning with “Because …” statements that connect the evidence to the conclusion.]
Optional: If you want to give the model a light heuristic without adding complexity, append this parenthetical to the first bullet: (e.g., termination for convenience, variable consideration mechanics, acceptance criteria, enforceable right to payment, license scope)

Keep the rest of the “CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS” block exactly as is.

Optional micro-tweak to the system prompt for consistency If you want the system prompt to align explicitly without adding complexity, adjust just one bullet in _get_markdown_system_prompt():
Current bullet:

Include relevant quotes from ASC 606 guidance when citing authoritative support
Replace with:

Paraphrase ASC 606 with pinpoint citations; brief decisive phrases may be quoted when directly supportive
This ensures the step prompt and system prompt are fully consistent. If you prefer not to touch the system prompt, the updated step prompt still governs behavior because it is more specific and appears later.

[Write comprehensive analysis in flowing paragraphs with professional reasoning. Include specific contract evidence and ASC 606 citations. Quote contract language only when the exact wording is outcome‑determinative; paraphrase ASC 606 with pinpoint citations and use only brief decisive phrases when directly supportive.]

Analysis: [Detailed analysis with supporting evidence. Include:

Contract evidence with direct quotes only when specific terms drive the conclusion (use "quotation marks" and bracketed pinpoint citations; e.g., [Contract §X.Y, p. N]).
ASC 606 guidance paraphrased with citations; include only brief decisive phrases when directly supportive (e.g., [ASC 606-10-25-19]).
Explicit reasoning with “Because …” statements that connect the evidence to the conclusion.]
Conclusion: [2–3 sentence conclusion summarizing the findings for this step, with at least one bracketed ASC 606 citation.]

Issues or Uncertainties: [If any significant issues exist, list them clearly and explain potential impact. Otherwise, state "None identified."]

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

Format currency as: $240,000 (with comma, NO SPACES between numbers)
NEVER write: $$240,000 or 
240
,
000
o
r
240
,
000
o
r
240,000or240,000or240000
ALWAYS put spaces after periods and commas in sentences
NEVER concatenate words: Write "professional services" NOT "professionalservices"
NEVER split words: Write "fees" NOT "f ees"
Write complete words: "the" NOT "T he", "and" NOT "and−"
Use normal dashes (-) NOT special characters (−)
Keep all text readable and properly spaced
Double-check ALL currency amounts for proper formatting
Use professional accounting language with proper spacing
Why this satisfies the goal with minimal risk
No new parameters, no UI, no template changes.
The model still provides traceability via bracketed citations.
Contract quotes appear only when they materially drive the conclusion.
ASC 606 remains paraphrase-first, with occasional brief phrases only.
Keeps your current clean architecture and is portable to future standards.
Quick test checklist
Run a contract that includes:
Termination for convenience and a price rebate.
Expect:
Contract quotes appear only around the determinative clauses (termination, rebate mechanics).
ASC 606 text is paraphrased with pinpoint citations; at most brief phrases appear.
“Because …” statements present in each step’s analysis or conclusion.
All currency and spacing rules intact.
If you want, I can provide the whole _get_step_markdown_prompt() function with these edits applied verbatim for a copy‑paste swap.
