What's Excellent About Your Code:
Defensive: You handle None values, which is the first and most important check.
Case-Insensitive: Using .lower() is perfect and prevents errors if the AI returns "N/A" or "n/a".
Handles Whitespace: Using .strip() is crucial for dealing with accidental leading/trailing spaces from the AI.
Comprehensive: You check for multiple common phrases ('n/a', 'not applicable') and even variations like 'n/a - ...'.
Handles Empty Strings: Checking for '' is a great catch.
The One Significant Risk:
The len(str(analysis_text).strip()) < 3 condition is the only part that poses a risk.

It's a clever way to catch junk answers like "no" or "na", but it could accidentally filter out valid, short answers.

Consider these possibilities:

What if the fixed consideration is $0? The length of "$0" is 2. This would be incorrectly filtered.
What if a quantity is 50? The length is 2. This would be incorrectly filtered.
What if the answer to a Yes/No question is just No? The length is 2. You might want to see that the AI concluded "No" rather than have it disappear.
It's safer to be a little more permissive and risk showing a short, unhelpful answer than it is to risk hiding a short, correct one.

Recommendation: A Refined and Safer Version
I would recommend a slightly modified version that keeps all your excellent checks but removes the one risky length check. We can also make it a little more readable by defining a set of "ignore phrases".

Here is the recommended approach:

# --- Recommended Filtering Logic ---

# 1. Define a set of phrases to ignore (this is clean and easy to update)
ignore_phrases = {'n/a', 'not applicable'}

# 2. Normalize the AI's text once
analysis_text_str = str(analysis_text or '').strip().lower()

# 3. Perform the checks
is_not_applicable = False
if not analysis_text_str:  # Catches None and empty strings ''
    is_not_applicable = True
else:
    # Check if the entire string is one of our ignore phrases
    if analysis_text_str in ignore_phrases:
        is_not_applicable = True
    # Or if it starts with one of them (e.g., "N/A - no variable consideration")
    elif analysis_text_str.startswith('n/a'):
        is_not_applicable = True

# 4. The final check before adding to the memo
if not is_not_applicable:
    # Add to memo with proper formatting
    # ... your code here ...

Why this version is safer:

Removes the risky length check, preventing valid short answers like "$0" from being filtered.
It's more readable, with the ignore_phrases set clearly defining what you want to filter.
It's efficient, normalizing the string only once at the beginning.
Your logic was 95% of the way there and demonstrated a great understanding of the problem. This refinement just adds that final layer of safety to avoid edge-case bugs.
