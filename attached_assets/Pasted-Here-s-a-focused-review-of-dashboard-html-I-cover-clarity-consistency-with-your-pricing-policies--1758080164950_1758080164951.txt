Here’s a focused review of dashboard.html. I cover clarity, consistency with your pricing/policies, UX, and key technical issues that will affect credibility and conversion. I’ve included copy you can paste and specific fixes for a few bugs.

Overall verdict

Strong skeleton and clear sections. To feel enterprise-ready, tighten authentication messaging, align credits with your 
500
/
500/1,000/$2,000 policy, surface the 12‑month expiration, and polish the History table with sorting and actions. Fix a few code bugs in credits/payment.
Head/SEO/security

Add noindex to avoid search engines indexing customer dashboards:
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
Optional but good: set a canonical to the dashboard root and add a stricter referrer policy:
<link rel="canonical" href="https://veritaslogic.ai/dashboard.html">
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
Consider a simple CSP later; not blocking for now.
Navigation

Clear. Consider adding a “Support” link in the nav or sidebar that opens mailto:support@veritaslogic.ai.
Authentication and login messaging

The current flow looks like email-only sign-in (no password) but you also offer password change. That’s confusing.
If you are “passwordless” (magic link/one-time code), reflect that:
Headline: “Sign in with your business email”
Subtext: “We’ll verify and sign you in” (or “Check your email for a magic link” if that’s your flow)
If you are moving to passwords, keep the login as email+password and remove “legacy” language.
Inline microcopy suggestions:
Replace “Enter your registered business email address to access your account.” with “Use your business email. We’ll verify and sign you in.”
Replace “Legacy users (email-only login) can leave this field blank” with a clearer line above the form:
“If you signed up without a password, you can set one here.”
Overview section (copy polish)

Add one reassurance line about credits and expiration:
Under Account Balance: “Credits expire 12 months from purchase.”
Add direct CTA microcopy:
On “Add Credits” button hover: “Buy credits (
500
,
500,1,000, $2,000).”
Credits section (policy alignment + clarity)

Align with your public pricing:

500increments.Keep“Contactsalesfor>2,000.”
Option B: If you keep custom: update the Pricing page to mention custom credits (breaks your current messaging).
Add explicit policy text:
“Credits expire 12 months from purchase. Credits are auto‑deducted per analysis based on the detected tier.”
Add small trust line:
“Payments are processed securely via Stripe.”
Payment UI and messaging

In “Selected Package” block, add expiration info:
“You will be charged $X USD. Credits expire 12 months from purchase.”
Replace alert-style errors with inline messages (you already have #payment-messages—good).
Add a link to view invoices/receipts (even if it’s “Coming soon”):
“Need an invoice? Contact support@veritaslogic.ai.”
Profile section

Let users edit company name (common need for invoicing) and possibly add “Billing contact email” (optional).
“Member since” should not default to today if missing—show “—” instead to avoid confusion.
Change password section

Clarify the model:
Add a short explainer above the form: “If you signed up without a password, you can set one now.”
Remove “legacy users” phrasing—it implies instability.
History section (enterprise expectations)

Add action buttons per row if available:
“View details,” “Download DOCX,” “Download PDF,” “Open in Analysis”
Add filters:
By date range, by standard (ASC 606, 842, etc.)
Add an export button:
“Export CSV”
Sorting:
Default to latest first; add clickable table headers for sorting.
Consistency with marketing site

Credits: enforce 
500
/
500/1,000/$2,000 blocks to match Pricing (and mention 12‑month expiration).
Time claims: use “3–5 minutes typical” consistently in any dashboard helper text/tooltips.
Support email: use support@veritaslogic.ai everywhere.
Accessibility/UX polish

Add aria-live="polite" to message containers (#loginMessage, #editProfileMessage, #changePasswordMessage, #payment-messages) so screen readers announce updates.
Add autocomplete attributes:
loginEmail autocomplete="email"
first/last name fields autocomplete="given-name"/"family-name"
Replace emoji-only headings with text+emoji for screen readers (you already have text; keep it that way).
Key technical issues/bugs to fix

Duplicate function name showCreditPurchase:
One version uses creditPurchaseSection (which doesn’t exist). Remove/rename this duplicate to avoid confusion.
selectCustomAmount calls undefined selectCreditPackage:
Replace with selectPackage(amount).
Numeric parsing bug in pollForBalanceUpdate:
You use parseInt on a string like “$1,095.00”, which becomes 1. Use a safer parse:
const originalBalance = Number(document.getElementById('creditsBalance').textContent.replace(/[^0-9.-]+/g, '')) || 0;
Stripe Element mount check:
cardElement._mounted is not part of the public API. Track your own flag:
let cardMounted = false; if (!cardMounted) { cardElement.mount('#card-element'); cardMounted = true; }
History sorting:
Sort analyses by created_at desc before rendering.
Currency formatting:
In usage stats and history costs, use toLocaleString for currency:
const fmt = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' });
fmt.format(number)
Member since default:
Don’t default to Date.now() if missing. Show “—”.
Missing element reference:
If you keep the “creditPurchaseSection” logic, add the corresponding DOM element; otherwise remove that code.
Ready-to-paste copy snippets

Credits policy (below Credit Packages heading):
“Credits expire 12 months from purchase and are automatically deducted per analysis based on document size. Payments are processed securely via Stripe.”
Selected package block:
<div class="selected-package-info"> <h4>Selected Package: $X Credits</h4> <p>You will be charged $X USD. Credits expire 12 months from purchase.</p> </div>
Account balance helper (small text under balance):
“Credits expire 12 months from purchase.”
Optional enhancements

Add a “Receipts” subsection under Credits (list Stripe charge date, amount, last4, invoice PDF link if available).
Add a “Support” card in Overview with support@veritaslogic.ai and “We respond within 4 business hours.”
Show earliest credit expiration date (e.g., “Earliest expiration: Jan 12, 2026”) if you track per‑purchase buckets.
