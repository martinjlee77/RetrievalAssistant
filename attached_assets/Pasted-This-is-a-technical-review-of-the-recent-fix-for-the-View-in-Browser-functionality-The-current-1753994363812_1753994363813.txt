This is a technical review of the recent fix for the "View in Browser" functionality.

The current implementation using a st.link_button with a Data URL is not a viable production solution and needs to be replaced. While adding URL encoding via urllib.parse.quote() correctly solves for special characters, it does not address the primary point of failure: the browser's maximum URL length limitation.

The Core Technical Issue: File Size vs. URL Length
You mentioned the memo's HTML size might be an issue. That is correct. A memo size of under 1 MB is the direct cause of this problem when using a Data URL.

Here is the technical breakdown:

Browser URL Limits: All browsers impose a hard limit on the maximum number of characters a URL can contain. For modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox, this limit is around 2 megabytes. While 1 MB seems less than 2 MB, it is dangerously close to this limit and will fail in many common enterprise environments.
Environmental Constraints: The 2 MB limit is not guaranteed. Network proxies, firewalls, and security gateways often enforce much smaller URL limits (e.g., 64KB - 256KB) and will truncate the request, leading to a blank page.
URL Encoding Increases Size: The urllib.parse.quote() function, while necessary for encoding special characters, increases the total character count. For example, a single space character ( ) becomes three characters (%20). A 1 MB raw HTML file can easily become 1.2 MB or more after encoding, pushing it over the browser limit.
Conclusion: The Data URL approach is fundamentally flawed for this use case because our generated memos are too large. It is not a scalable or reliable method.

The Required Production-Ready Solution
The correct and standard industry practice is to use JavaScript to dynamically write the HTML content into a new tab. This method completely bypasses the URL length limitation because the content is not passed via the URL itself.

The implementation must be changed as follows:

Use a standard st.button instead of st.link_button.
When the button is clicked, render a small HTML component containing a <script> tag.
This script will programmatically open a new tab and write the memo's HTML content into it.
Here is a function that provides this functionality. It should be added to utils/html_export.py or a similar utility file and called from the main page.

# In a utility file like utils/html_export.py or similar

import streamlit as st
import streamlit.components.v1 as components
import json

def render_view_in_browser_button(html_content: str):
    """
    Renders a button that, when clicked, uses JavaScript to open a new tab
    and write the provided HTML content to it. This bypasses URL length limits.
    """
    # Use a unique key for the button to maintain state
    button_key = "view_in_browser_button"

    if st.button("üåê View in Browser", use_container_width=True, key=button_key, help="Opens the styled memo in a new browser tab."):
        # Safely embed the Python string into the JavaScript block
        # using json.dumps() to handle quotes, newlines, and other special characters.
        safe_html_content = json.dumps(html_content)

        # The JavaScript code to be executed
        js_code = f"""
            <script>
            // This function runs when the component is rendered
            (function() {{
                // 1. Open a new, blank browser tab.
                const newWindow = window.open("", "_blank");

                // 2. Get the HTML content passed from Python.
                const htmlContent = {safe_html_content};

                // 3. Write the content to the new tab's document.
                newWindow.document.open();
                newWindow.document.write(htmlContent);
                newWindow.document.close();
            }})();
            </script>
        """
        # Render the HTML component with the script. The script runs automatically.
        components.html(js_code, height=0, width=0)

Action Items
Remove the entire try/except block for the st.link_button in the asc_606_page.py file.
Implement the new solution. Import and call the render_view_in_browser_button function from the appropriate utility file, passing the html_content to it.
Example Implementation in asc_606_page.py:

# In asc_606_page.py

# ... import the new function
from utils.html_export import render_view_in_browser_button, convert_memo_to_html # Assuming it's in html_export.py

# ... inside the "else" block where results are displayed
# ...

# Column 2: View in Browser (Correct JavaScript Approach)
with dl_col2:
    render_view_in_browser_button(html_content)

# ...

This change is not a suggestion; it is the required implementation to ensure this feature works reliably for all users and all memo sizes.

Please implement this fix and test it with a large contract analysis to confirm it resolves the blank page issue permanently.
