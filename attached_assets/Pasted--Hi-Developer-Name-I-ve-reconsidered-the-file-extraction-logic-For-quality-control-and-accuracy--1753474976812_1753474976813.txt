"Hi [Developer Name], I've reconsidered the file extraction logic. For quality control and accuracy, we cannot proceed with an analysis if any of the uploaded documents fail text extraction.

Please update the 'Engine Room' code with the following logic:

Iterate through the uploaded files.
If any file fails the extraction process, immediately stop the analysis.
Display a specific and helpful error message that tells the user exactly which file(s) failed and suggests possible ways for them to fix it."
The Corrected "Engine Room" Code (Text Extraction Part)
This new code block should replace the existing text extraction logic inside the with st.status(...) block.

# --- Start of new code block ---

# Inside the `with st.status(...)` and `try:` blocks...

# 1. More robust text extraction with a "stop on failure" policy
st.write("ðŸ“„ Verifying and extracting text from documents...")
all_extracted_text = []
failed_files = []

for f in uploaded_files:
    try:
        extraction_result = extractor.extract_text(f)
        # Check if the extraction returned a valid result with actual text
        if extraction_result and extraction_result.get('text'):
            all_extracted_text.append(extraction_result['text'])
        else:
            # The file was processed but no text was found (e.g., a scanned image PDF)
            failed_files.append(f.name)
    except Exception:
        # The extractor itself threw an error (e.g., corrupted or password-protected file)
        failed_files.append(f.name)

# 2. Check for failures and stop the process if any exist
if failed_files:
    # Construct a helpful, multi-line error message
    error_message = (
        f"**Text extraction failed for the following file(s):**\n"
        f"- `{'`, `'.join(failed_files)}`\n\n"
        "**Please check the file(s) and try again. Common reasons for failure include:**\n"
        "- The file is password-protected.\n"
        "- The PDF is an image-only scan with no machine-readable text.\n"
        "- The file is corrupted or in an unsupported format."
    )
    st.error(error_message, icon="ðŸš¨")
    st.stop() # Immediately halt the analysis

# This part only runs if all files were successful
combined_text = "\n\n--- END OF DOCUMENT ---\n\n".join(all_extracted_text)

# The rest of the "Engine Room" code (Processing answers, creating ContractData, etc.) remains the same.

# --- End of new code block ---

Why This New Logic is Better
Fail-Safe: It completely prevents an analysis based on incomplete data, protecting the user and the integrity of the output.
Actionable Error Message: It doesn't just say "Error." It tells the user:
Which file is the problem.
Why it might be a problem (password, scanned image, corruption). This empowers the user to fix the issue themselves without needing to contact support.
Professional: This level of error checking and user guidance is expected in a high-quality professional tool.
This is a fantastic decision that significantly improves the robustness and reliability of your application.
