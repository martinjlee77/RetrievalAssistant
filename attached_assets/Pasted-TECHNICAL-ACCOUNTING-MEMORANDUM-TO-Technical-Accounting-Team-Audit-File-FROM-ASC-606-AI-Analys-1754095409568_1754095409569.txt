Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Conclusion:
The analysis concludes that the Netflix subscription service constitutes a single performance obligation, as it provides a continuous service without distinct separable components.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Performance Obligation Analysis

The Netflix subscription service, as described in the contract, involves providing continuous access to streaming content for a monthly fee. According to ASC 606-10-25-19, a good or service is distinct if it is both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable. In this case, the streaming service is not capable of being distinct because it does not provide individual components that can be separately used by the customer. Furthermore, the service is not separately identifiable as it is a continuous service that is substantially the same throughout the subscription period. Therefore, the Netflix subscription service is considered a single performance obligation. This conclusion is supported by the nature of the service, which provides a series of substantially the same services over time, aligning with ASC 606-10-25-14.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price for the Netflix subscription is determined to be a fixed monthly fee of $15.49, with no variable considerations or significant financing components involved.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Fixed Consideration
The fixed consideration is $15.49 per month as specified in the invoice and pricing documents.

2. Other Considerations
The transaction price includes a tax component of $1.03, making the total monthly payment $16.52. There are no refund liabilities or nonrefundable upfront fees affecting the transaction price.

3. Total Transaction Price
$15.49 per month, excluding tax.

4. Fixed Consideration Analysis
The contract specifies a fixed monthly fee of $15.49 for the Netflix subscription service, as outlined in the invoice and pricing documents. According to ASC 606-10-32-2, fixed consideration is the portion of the transaction price that is not subject to variability. Since the monthly fee does not vary based on future events or customer actions, it represents fixed consideration. Therefore, the transaction price is straightforward and does not involve any variable considerations.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price is allocated entirely to the single performance obligation identified in Step 2, as there are no variable considerations or discounts applicable.

Detailed Analysis:

No additional analysis was required for this step.
Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Conclusion:
Revenue for the Netflix subscription service is recognized over time as the service is delivered continuously throughout the subscription period, meeting the criteria for 'Over Time' recognition under ASC 606.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Revenue Recognition for Subscription Services
The contract specifies a monthly subscription fee of $15.49 for access to Netflix's streaming service, which is billed on a monthly basis. According to ASC 606-10-25-23, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. In this case, the service is delivered continuously over the subscription period, as the customer has access to the streaming service at any time during the month. This aligns with ASC 606-10-25-27(a), which states that revenue should be recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs. The straight-line method is appropriate here as it reflects the uniform delivery of service throughout the month. An alternative treatment of recognizing revenue at a point in time was rejected because the service is not delivered at a single point but rather continuously over the month.
