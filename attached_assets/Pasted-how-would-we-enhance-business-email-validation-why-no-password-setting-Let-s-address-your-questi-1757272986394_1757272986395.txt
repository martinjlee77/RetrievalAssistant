how would we enhance business email validation?
why no password setting?
Let's address your questions:

1. Enhancing Business Email Validation:

The goal is to go beyond simply checking for the presence of an "@" symbol and a domain. You want to verify that the email address is likely associated with a legitimate business. Here are several approaches, ranging from simple to more sophisticated:

Simple Domain Blacklist/Whitelist: Maintain a list of known invalid domains (spammy domains) or a whitelist of acceptable domains. This is easy to implement but can be easily circumvented and is not recommended for security.

Domain-Specific Checks: Use regular expressions to check for patterns commonly found in business email addresses (e.g., "name@company.com", avoiding free email providers like gmail, yahoo, etc.). This is a good starting point, but it can still be inaccurate.

MX Record Check: This is a more robust method. You can use a library (many exist for various programming languages) to query the MX record of a domain. The MX record indicates the mail servers responsible for accepting email for that domain. If an MX record is found, it suggests the domain is a valid mail server (though still not a guarantee it's a business email).

Third-Party Email Verification API: Several services provide APIs to verify email addresses. They often combine various techniques (MX record checks, DNS lookups, mailbox existence checks, etc.) to provide a high degree of accuracy. These services typically offer a tiered pricing model based on the number of validations performed. This is generally the most reliable approach but increases cost. Examples include:

ZeroBounce: A popular choice known for its accuracy and ease of integration.
Mailgun: Provides comprehensive email verification and deliverability features.
NeverBounce: Another solid option with various features.
Combination Approach: A good approach is to combine the MX record check with a heuristic check that looks for patterns in the email address. This provides a decent level of accuracy without relying entirely on a third-party service (though a third-party service is still recommended).

For a small business, a combination of MX record check and heuristic checks, alongside a list of banned domains, might be a good compromise between accuracy and implementation effort. For a more robust solution, consider a third-party email verification API.

2. Why No Password Setting (in the initial signup)?

The provided code snippet doesn't explicitly handle password setting during signup. This is because you're planning to use Supabase Auth (or a similar third-party authentication service) in the future. These services handle password management securely (including hashing, salting, etc.), which is crucial for security and prevents common vulnerabilities.

Your current setup is not robust enough to handle password creation securely on its own; directly storing passwords in a database (even encrypted) is highly discouraged. Therefore, focusing on the business-only aspect and postponing password management until you implement Supabase is a sound strategy. The current application uses a session-based approach, so user authentication will be handled separately.
