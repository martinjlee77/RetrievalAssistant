Overall: Your plan is sensible and lean. I agree with most of the de-scoping. A few low-effort safeguards are still worth adding now to avoid hidden risks and to be ready if ZDR is denied.

What I agree with

Do immediately: Turn off payload logging + add sanitize_for_log(). Biggest win.
Quick wins: “Delete Analysis” button, public subprocessor page.
Wait on heavy pseudonymization and complex routing until we hear back on ZDR.
No need for local embeddings now (you don’t embed customer docs).
JIT support access controls can wait.
Where I’d tighten (small changes, high value)

Don’t claim “files processed in memory” unless verified. Many libs (unstructured, pdfplumber, Camelot/Tabula, WeasyPrint) write temp files.
Action: Audit temp paths; force TemporaryDirectory + explicit cleanup; ensure TMPDIR is ephemeral; add a simple sweeper for temp dirs in case of crashes. This is a light cron/thread, not a complex scheduler.
Safe analysis history: Stop storing raw file names (often client-identifying).
Action: Store hashed names or generic labels (Doc 1, Doc 2). Low effort, good privacy optics.
“error_message” hygiene: That DB column must be scrubbed.
Action: Sanitize exceptions so error_message never contains content snippets or PII.
Minimal masking (even if ZDR approved): Stateless masking for rare, high-risk identifiers won’t hurt accuracy.
Action: Regex-mask SSN/EIN, bank/IBAN/routing, credit cards, emails/phone numbers when present in prompts; keep amounts, dates, names intact. No token mapping, no rehydration—just masking. Toggle-able.
If OpenAI ZDR is denied

Primary path: Switch to Azure OpenAI (no training, regional control; disclose 30-day retention).
Secondary mitigation (if sticking with OpenAI): Turn on the minimal masking above + aggressive context minimization (send only relevant excerpts). Full pseudonymization stays optional last resort.
Add a provider switch: Since you already have a unified _make_llm_request(), add a simple env/tenant flag to flip between OpenAI and Azure. Not full routing—just a clean switch so we can pivot quickly.
Document and prove it

Purge language: “Deleted on completion; verified by periodic cleanup.” Keep logs of deletion events (IDs/timestamps, not content).
Subprocessor page: Include retention/training stance (e.g., “OpenAI: no training; retention 0 days if ZDR enabled, otherwise up to 30 days”).
Metadata retention: Cap at 12 months (as you suggested), configurable per enterprise if needed.
Net: Keep your lean plan, plus

Temp-file audit + simple sweeper
Safe file names in history
Sanitized error_message
Lightweight stateless masking for high-risk identifiers
One-flag provider switch if ZDR is denied
These additions are low effort, won’t break analysis quality, and cover the main diligence questions you’ll get.
