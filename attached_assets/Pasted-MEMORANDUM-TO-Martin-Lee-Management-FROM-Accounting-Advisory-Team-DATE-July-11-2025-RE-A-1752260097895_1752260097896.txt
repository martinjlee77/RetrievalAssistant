MEMORANDUM

TO: Martin Lee Management  
FROM: Accounting Advisory Team  
DATE: July 11, 2025  
RE: ASC 606 Analysis - Test01  

**Executive Summary**

This memorandum provides an analysis of the revenue recognition process for a monthly subscription service under ASC 606. The service in question is a streaming content subscription with a fixed monthly fee of USD 15.49, inclusive of USD 1.03 in taxes, for the period from September 26, 2024, to October 25, 2024. The analysis confirms that the contract meets all necessary criteria under ASC 606, with a low complexity assessment due to its straightforward nature. Revenue will be recognized ratably over the service period as the performance obligation is satisfied over time.

**Analysis by Step**

**Step 1: Contract Identification**  
The contract for the streaming service is confirmed to exist as it meets all criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1. The contract has been approved by both parties, with identifiable rights and payment terms, commercial substance, and a probable collection of consideration. These findings are based on authoritative sources.

**Step 2: Performance Obligations**  
The analysis identifies a single performance obligation: the provision of the streaming service for the specified period. This obligation is distinct as it is separately identifiable and provides a benefit to the customer independently. The distinctness of the service is supported by authoritative guidance.

**Step 3: Transaction Price**  
The transaction price is fixed at USD 15.49, with no variable consideration identified. This fixed consideration simplifies the revenue recognition process, as confirmed by authoritative sources.

**Step 4: Price Allocation**  
Given the presence of a single performance obligation, no allocation of the transaction price is necessary. All consideration is allocated to the streaming service, aligning with authoritative guidance.

**Step 5: Revenue Recognition**  
Revenue will be recognized over the service period from September 26, 2024, to October 25, 2024, as the performance obligation is satisfied over time. This recognition pattern is consistent with the authoritative guidance provided in ASC 606.

**Implementation Guidance**

To ensure compliance with ASC 606, the following steps should be implemented:

1. **Contract Review**: Confirm that all contracts meet the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1.
2. **Performance Obligation Assessment**: Identify and document all performance obligations, ensuring they are distinct and separately identifiable.
3. **Transaction Price Verification**: Ensure the transaction price is accurately determined and documented, with no variable consideration unless explicitly identified.
4. **Revenue Recognition Process**: Implement a system to recognize revenue ratably over the service period, ensuring alignment with the satisfaction of performance obligations.
