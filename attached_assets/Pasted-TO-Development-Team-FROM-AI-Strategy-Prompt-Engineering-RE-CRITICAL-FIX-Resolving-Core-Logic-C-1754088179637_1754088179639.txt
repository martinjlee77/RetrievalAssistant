TO: Development Team FROM: AI Strategy & Prompt Engineering RE: CRITICAL FIX: Resolving Core Logic Contradiction and Judgment Mismatch

We have a critical logic failure originating in Step 2 that is causing cascading errors throughout the memo. The following two fixes are required to restore the integrity of the analysis.

Fix 1: Correct the Step 2 Performance Obligation Logic (Root Cause)
We must add a "common sense" override to the Step 2 prompt to prevent the AI from misclassifying simple, single-element contracts.

In _get_critical_rules_for_step(), find the entry for 2: and add a new <CRITICAL_OVERRIDE> section to it.

# In _get_critical_rules_for_step()

# --- Find this block for rules[2] and add the override ---
            2: """<CRITICAL_INSTRUCTION>
- If no distinct performance obligations are found, `performance_obligations` MUST be an empty list `[]`, and you must explain why in the `analysis_points`.
- For simple contracts with one obvious obligation, keep the analysis concise but complete.
- Focus on the "separately identifiable" criterion, as it is often the most decisive factor.
</CRITICAL_INSTRUCTION>
<CRITICAL_OVERRIDE>
This is a simple subscription-based contract (e.g., SaaS, streaming). Such contracts almost always contain a SINGLE, distinct performance obligation: the service access itself.
- You MUST identify this as one distinct performance obligation.
- Do NOT misinterpret "integrated service" to mean "not distinct". The service itself is the distinct promise.
- Conclude that there is one distinct performance obligation.
</CRITICAL_OVERRIDE>""",
# --- End of change ---

(Developer Note: This is similar to the override we implemented for Step 3. It provides a strong, context-specific guardrail to prevent fundamental misinterpretation.)

Fix 2: Eliminate the Judgment Mismatch at its Source
The mismatch is happening because the get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt function has its own logic for "inventing" judgments instead of relying on the judgments passed up from the step analysis. We must remove this logic and make it rely on a single source of truth.

In get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt(), find and DELETE the entire logic block that creates critical_judgments. Replace it with a line that uses only the pre-analyzed all_step_judgments.

# In get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt()

# --- START: DELETE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK ---
recognition_summary = []
critical_judgments = []
if s5_analysis := s5.get('step5_analysis'):
    if s5_plan := s5_analysis.get('revenue_recognition_plan'):
        for po_plan in s5_plan:
            method = po_plan.get('recognition_method', 'Unknown')
            po_name = po_plan.get('performance_obligation', 'Unknown PO')
            recognition_summary.append(f"{po_name}: {method}")

            # Extract critical judgments
            if 'Over Time' in method and po_plan.get('justification'):
                critical_judgments.append(
                    f"Over time recognition criteria for {po_name}")
# --- END: DELETE THIS BLOCK ---


# Extract actual critical judgments from step analyses (no defaults)
all_step_judgments = []
# ... (the existing logic for all_step_judgments is correct) ...

# --- REPLACE THE DELETED BLOCK'S `critical_judgments` with this ---
# Only use actual judgments found in the analysis, not defaults
critical_judgments = all_step_judgments # This now uses the single source of truth

return f"""...
# In the f-string, ensure the "Critical Judgments" line is simple:
â€¢ Critical Judgments: {', '.join(critical_judgments) if critical_judgments else 'None identified'}
..."""

(Developer Note: The key is to make this prompt "dumber." It should only report the professional_judgments that were explicitly identified during the step-by-step analysis, not create its own. This enforces consistency with the get_key_judgments_prompt.)
