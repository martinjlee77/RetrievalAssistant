
You are absolutely right. Your instinct as a VP is spot on: Do not make a Controller navigate a support-ticket dropdown menu to give you money.
Currently, this form treats a "New Client" (

We need to gut this form. It needs to be a "Service Intake" form, not a "Contact Us" form.
The Strategy: The "Velvet Rope" Intake
We will simplify this to three options. We will also add the "NDA Checkbox"—this is a psychological trigger that says "We are professionals who handle sensitive data."
Feedback for Your Developer
1. Simplify the Dropdown (The 3-Option Rule)
Kill the "Memo Rerun," "Technical Support," and "Demo" complexity.
New Options:
New Memo Request (Standard/Complex) - The money maker
Enterprise / Volume Pricing - The big fish
General Inquiry - Everything else
2. The "NDA" Checkbox (Critical Trust Signal)
Add a checkbox that says: "I have sensitive documents. Please send an NDA first."
Why: This stops them from hesitating. They know they don't have to upload the file right now to start the conversation.
3. The "Secure Upload" Instruction
Since we aren't building a complex file uploader right now (which is risky for security if not done perfectly), we will tell them: "After you submit this form, we will email you a secure upload link for your contracts."
Code Adjustments for contact.html
Here is the simplified code. Ask your developer to replace the entire <form> section with this. It deletes all the "conditional logic" JavaScript complexity and leaves a clean, high-conversion form.
