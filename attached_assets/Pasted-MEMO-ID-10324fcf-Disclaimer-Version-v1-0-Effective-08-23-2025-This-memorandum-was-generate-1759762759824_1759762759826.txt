RE: Contract Analysis - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis

DOCUMENTS REVIEWED: gemini_sow.docx

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We identified three distinct performance obligations: (1) the Logi-AI Suite SaaS subscription (series of services), (2) delivery of 200 OptiScan-7 scanners, and (3) a bundled professional services engagement (implementation, ERP integration, and training), each capable of being distinct and separately identifiable within the contract. The fixed transaction price is $845,000 with variable consideration of $0 to $30,000 tied to a performance bonus; no significant financing component, noncash consideration, or consideration payable to the customer is present.

We will allocate the transaction price based on relative SSP at contract inception, with the stated 10% discount allocated solely to hardware and professional services (not SaaS) to the extent the discount-specific allocation criteria are met. Revenue recognition is compliant with ASC 606, with SaaS recognized over time on a time‑elapsed basis, hardware recognized at a point in time upon delivery and acceptance, and professional services recognized over time using an input method, while the $30,000 performance bonus is recognized only when not constrained.

BACKGROUND
We reviewed an arrangement with Customer for a bundled solution that includes the Logi-AI Suite SaaS subscription, delivery of OptiScan-7 scanners, and a professional services engagement (implementation, ERP integration, and training). This memo assesses the contract under ASC 606 to identify the distinct performance obligations, determine and allocate the transaction price, and establish the appropriate revenue recognition patterns for each element.

ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Analysis: From InnovateTech’s perspective, the SOW is a contract under an existing MSA and sets out mutual obligations, deliverables, and pricing. We evaluate the ASC 606-10-25-1 criteria as follows.

Approval and commitment to perform (ASC 606-10-25-1(a)). The SOW states it is “entered into as of October 26, 2023” between InnovateTech and the Customer under an MSA dated January 15, 2022 [Contract, “entered into as of October 26, 2023”]. Because the SOW specifies the parties, effective date, scope, fees, and timelines—and is issued under an existing MSA—this evidences approval and a commitment to perform their respective obligations at least for the enforceable period. While the SaaS term “can be terminated for convenience with a 30-day notice” [Contract, “can be terminated for convenience with a 30-day notice”], that termination right limits duration but does not negate present enforceable obligations (for example, delivery of hardware within 14 days and initial access to the SaaS). Therefore, criterion (a) is met.

Each party’s rights regarding goods or services (ASC 606-10-25-1(b)). The SOW clearly identifies the goods and services InnovateTech will transfer and the Customer’s corresponding rights: a 3‑year subscription to the Logi‑AI Suite for up to 500 users with standard support and monthly feature updates [Contract, 1.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License]; 200 OptiScan‑7 scanners with “Title and risk of loss … transfer to the Customer upon delivery” [Contract, 1.2 Hardware Provisioning, “Title and risk of loss … upon delivery”]; and professional services for implementation, integration, and on‑site training that are “considered complete upon Customer’s written acceptance” [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services]. Acceptance criteria are defined for delivery of all scanners and written sign‑off for the professional services [Contract, Acceptance Criteria]. Because the SOW specifies what is to be provided, when acceptance occurs, and when title/risk transfer for hardware, it identifies the rights related to the goods and services to be transferred, satisfying criterion (b).

Payment terms (ASC 606-10-25-1(c)). The payment terms are explicit: SaaS fees of $240,000 per year, with the first year “due and payable Net 30” from the Effective Date and Years 2 and 3 “due at the beginning of each respective contract year” [Contract, 2.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, “$240,000 per year,” “Net 30,” “beginning of each respective contract year”]. Hardware is a one‑time $50,000 fee “due and payable Net 30” [Contract, 2.2 Hardware (OptiScan‑7 Scanners), “Net 30”]. Professional services are a one‑time $75,000 fee “due and payable Net 30” [Contract, 2.3 Professional Services, “Net 30”]. A one‑time $30,000 performance bonus is contingent on achieving a 15% shipping cost reduction within 12 months measured by Customer’s systems [Contract, 2.4 Performance Bonus]. The SOW also notes a “10% discount” applied to the hardware and services list prices [Contract, 2.5 Bundle Discount]. Because amounts and due dates are specified for each promised good or service, criterion (c) is met.

Commercial substance (ASC 606-10-25-1(d)). The arrangement will change InnovateTech’s future cash flows through fixed consideration of $240,000 per year for 3 years (subject to termination rights), $50,000 for hardware, $75,000 for services, and potential $30,000 bonus, with specified billing timing (Net 30 for most) [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule]. Because this contract alters the timing and amount of cash flows, it has commercial substance, satisfying criterion (d).

Probable collectibility (ASC 606-10-25-1(e)). ASC 606 requires assessing whether it is probable the entity will collect substantially all consideration to which it will be entitled “in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred” and to focus on the customer’s ability and intention to pay that consideration when due [ASC 606-10-25-1(e)]. The SOW defines near-term transfers (hardware delivery within 14 days; initial SaaS access, and services targeted within 60 days) and clear invoicing (“Net 30” terms) [Contract, 3.2 Timeline; Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule, “Net 30”]. Because the contract includes a termination-for-convenience provision with 30 days’ notice, the collectibility assessment should be based on the consideration for goods/services expected to be transferred during the enforceable period rather than all promised over 36 months [ASC 606-10-25-1(e) (assess consideration for goods/services that will be transferred)]. However, the SOW provides no information about the Customer’s credit profile, payment history, or other evidence of ability and intention to pay. Therefore, while the payment terms are clear, a conclusion that collectibility is “probable” requires a credit assessment outside the contract. In the absence of such information in the provided text, collectibility is Not specified in contract.

Conclusion: We conclude criteria (a) approval/commitment, (b) identification of rights, (c) identification of payment terms, and (d) commercial substance are satisfied based on the SOW. Criterion (e) collectibility cannot be confirmed from the contract alone; management must assess the Customer’s ability and intention to pay for the enforceable goods/services to be transferred [ASC 606-10-25-1(e)]. Subject to a positive collectibility assessment, a contract exists for ASC 606 purposes [ASC 606-10-25-1].

Issues or Uncertainties:

Collectibility assessment: The SOW lacks credit information for the Customer. Management must evaluate the Customer’s ability and intention to pay to conclude criterion (e) is met [ASC 606-10-25-1(e)].
Termination for convenience: The 30‑day termination right may limit the enforceable contract period for accounting purposes; this affects the scope of consideration included in the collectibility assessment and will be addressed in contract duration/Step 2 (Not specified in contract whether any termination penalties or refund obligations exist).
MSA terms not provided: Certain enforceability, refund, or termination provisions may reside in the MSA and could affect both contract duration and collectibility (Not specified in contract).
Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Analysis:

Promised goods and services. The SOW promises the following to the Customer: (1) a subscription to the Logi-AI Suite SaaS including “standard support and maintenance, with monthly feature updates” for 36 months [Contract, 1.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License]; (2) delivery of 200 proprietary OptiScan-7 handheld scanners with “Title and risk of loss … upon delivery” [Contract, 1.2 Hardware Provisioning]; and (3) a one-time bundle of professional services for “implementation, system integration, and on-site user training,” which are “considered complete upon Customer's written acceptance” [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services; Contract, 4.0 Acceptance Criteria]. The contract also includes a contingent “Performance Bonus” [Contract, 2.4 Performance Bonus] and a “Bundle Discount” applied to hardware and services within this SOW [Contract, 2.5 Bundle Discount]. Under ASC 606, we identify performance obligations at contract inception for each distinct promised good or service or bundle, including a series of distinct services with the same pattern of transfer [ASC 606-10-25-14].

1) Logi-AI Suite SaaS (including standard support and updates).

Capable of being distinct. The Customer can benefit from access to the SaaS on its own (i.e., the platform provides logistics management functionality and standard support/updates are part of providing that hosted service). The contract states the platform “can be used without [the professional] services” [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services], confirming that the SaaS has stand-alone utility. This meets the “capable of being distinct” criterion because the Customer can benefit from the SaaS on its own or with other readily available resources [ASC 606-10-25-20].
Distinct within the context of the contract. The SaaS is not significantly integrated with the hardware or the professional services into a single combined output. InnovateTech can fulfill its promise to provide SaaS access separately from delivering scanners and performing services, and those other items do not significantly customize the SaaS. The SaaS and services are not highly interdependent; each can be transferred independently (for example, SaaS access begins at contract start and hardware is delivered within 14 days; services complete later with separate acceptance) [Contract, 3.2 Timeline; Contract, 4.0 Acceptance Criteria]. By analogy to ASC 606’s equipment/installation example, when there is no significant integration, modification, or interdependence, promises are separately identifiable [ASC 606-10-25-21(a)-(c)].
Conclusion for SaaS. We conclude the SaaS (together with included standard support/updates) is a distinct performance obligation. Because SaaS access is provided continuously over time in substantially the same manner, it is a “series of distinct services” accounted for as a single performance obligation under the series guidance [ASC 606-10-25-14(b)].
2) OptiScan-7 hardware (200 units).

Capable of being distinct. The scanners are tangible goods transferred with title and risk passing at delivery [Contract, 1.2 Hardware Provisioning]. The Customer can benefit from the scanners with the SaaS in the contract (a readily available resource) or potentially in other warehouse workflows. Although the scanners are said to be “required for optimal use” of certain real-time tracking features [Contract, 1.2 Hardware Provisioning], the SaaS itself has stand-alone utility. Thus, the capability criterion is met [ASC 606-10-25-20].
Distinct within the context of the contract. InnovateTech is not providing a significant integration service that transforms the scanners and SaaS/services into a combined output; the scanners are delivered and control transfers independently (point in time), and the services do not significantly customize the scanners [Contract, 3.2 Timeline; Contract, 4.0 Acceptance Criteria]. The scanners and other promises are not highly interdependent because InnovateTech can fulfill delivery of scanners without performing the SaaS or services and vice versa [ASC 606-10-25-21(a)-(c)].
Conclusion for hardware. The scanners are a distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time (timing assessed in Step 5).
3) Professional services (implementation, system integration to Customer’s ERP, and on-site user training).

Capable of being distinct. The Customer can benefit from these services together with the SaaS, and the contract explicitly states the platform “can be used without these services” [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services], indicating the services are not necessary to obtain benefit from the SaaS. Therefore, these services are capable of being distinct [ASC 606-10-25-20].
Distinct within the context of the contract. We evaluate both (a) whether the services are distinct from the SaaS/hardware, and (b) whether the individual service tasks within the professional services bundle are distinct from each other:
From SaaS/hardware: The services do not significantly customize the SaaS or scanners and are not integrated into a single combined output with them. InnovateTech can fulfill SaaS and hardware promises independently of completing services. Accordingly, the services are separately identifiable from SaaS and hardware [ASC 606-10-25-21(a)-(c)].
Within the services bundle: The SOW prices and accepts these activities as a single one-time engagement with “written acceptance” upon completion [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services; Contract, 4.0 Acceptance Criteria], and the tasks (implementation, ERP integration, training) are designed to work together to achieve the combined output of a deployed and user-ready solution. Because these activities are highly interrelated and are combined to deliver one outcome (deployment and enablement), they are not separately identifiable from each other within the contract and are combined into one services performance obligation [ASC 606-10-25-21(a), 25-22].
Conclusion for services. The professional services constitute one distinct performance obligation separate from the SaaS and hardware, with completion upon customer acceptance as specified in the SOW (timing assessed in Step 5).
Other considerations.

Performance bonus. The $30,000 performance bonus is variable consideration related to achieving a cost reduction outcome [Contract, 2.4 Performance Bonus]. It is not a promised good or service and therefore is not a performance obligation; it will be evaluated for variable consideration and constraint in later steps (Step 3/Step 4).
Bundle discount. The “10% discount on the standard standalone list prices for the hardware and services” is pricing within this contract and does not provide an option for future purchases; therefore, it is not a separate performance obligation or material right [Contract, 2.5 Bundle Discount; ASC 606-10-55-41 to 55-45].
Principal vs. agent. The SOW specifies InnovateTech’s proprietary platform and scanners and InnovateTech’s delivery of services, with no third-party suppliers identified. Because InnovateTech controls the platform access, hardware, and services before transfer, it acts as principal, not agent [ASC 606-10-55-36 to 55-40].
Termination for convenience. The SaaS term is 36 months but “can be terminated for convenience with a 30-day notice” [Contract, 3.1 Term]. This may affect contract term and transaction price for the SaaS in Step 1/Step 3, but it does not change the identification of the SaaS series as a performance obligation.
Because the SaaS access (with standard support/updates) provides continuous benefit over time and can be provided independently, because the scanners transfer control independently without significant integration or customization, and because the professional services are capable of being distinct and are not integrated with SaaS/hardware into a combined output, we identify three performance obligations: (1) SaaS subscription (series), (2) hardware scanners, and (3) a bundled professional services engagement [ASC 606-10-25-14; 25-20; 25-21(a)-(c); 25-22].

Conclusion:

We conclude there are three distinct performance obligations: (1) the Logi-AI Suite SaaS subscription (a series of services), (2) delivery of 200 OptiScan-7 scanners, and (3) a bundled professional services engagement (implementation, ERP integration, and training). This conclusion is supported because each is capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable within the context of the contract, with no significant integration or customization across the categories [ASC 606-10-25-14; 25-20; 25-21(a)-(c); 25-22].

Issues or Uncertainties:

Termination for convenience may affect the enforceable contract term and variable consideration for the SaaS in subsequent steps.
No third-party involvement is specified; if third parties are later identified for hardware fulfillment or services delivery, principal/agent considerations would need to be reassessed.
None otherwise identified.
Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Analysis:

Fixed consideration totals $845,000 based on stated contractual prices. The SaaS license is $240,000 per year for three years (total $720,000) with the first year due “Net 30 from the Effective Date” and years 2 and 3 “due at the beginning of each respective contract year” [Contract, 2.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: $240,000 per year]. Hardware is a one-time $50,000 due Net 30 [Contract, 2.2 Hardware (OptiScan-7 Scanners): A one-time fixed fee of $50,000], and professional services are a one-time $75,000 due Net 30 [Contract, 2.3 Professional Services: A one-time fixed fee of $75,000]. Because these amounts are fixed and stipulated, we include $720,000 (SaaS) + $50,000 (hardware) + $75,000 (services) = $845,000 in fixed consideration [ASC 606-10-25-14].

Variable consideration exists for the performance bonus. InnovateTech is eligible for a one-time $30,000 bonus if the Customer achieves a 15% shipping cost reduction within the first 12 months, measured by the Customer’s internal reporting; InnovateTech’s history indicates an 80% success rate with similar-size customers [Contract, 2.4 Performance Bonus: InnovateTech is eligible for a one-time $30,000 performance bonus... 80% of its customers]. Because the bonus is a binary outcome, the “most likely amount” method is generally appropriate to estimate the variable consideration (either $0 or $30,000) [ASC 606-10-32-8 to 32-9]. However, estimated variable amounts are included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that recognizing them will not result in a significant revenue reversal when resolved [ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-13]. Because the outcome depends on the Customer’s cost reductions and the Customer’s internal reporting (factors outside the entity’s control) and will be resolved over up to 12 months, there is heightened risk of reversal under the constraint factors [ASC 606-10-32-12]. Management must perform and document the constraint assessment at contract inception. If management concludes it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur given the 80% historical success with similar customers, then $30,000 may be included; otherwise, the bonus should be constrained to $0 until the uncertainty is resolved [ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-13].

The contract includes termination for convenience with 30 days’ notice [Contract, 3.1 Term: the contract can be terminated for convenience with a 30-day notice]. For determining the transaction price, we must assume the contract will be performed as written and not cancelled [ASC 606-10-32-4]. Accordingly, we base the transaction price on the full three-year term for Step 3.

Significant financing component. We evaluate whether the timing of payments provides a significant financing benefit to either party. For hardware and professional services, consideration is due Net 30 and transfer occurs within 14–60 days [Contract, 2.2 Hardware; 2.3 Professional Services; 3.2 Timeline], resulting in short intervals. For the SaaS, the first year’s fee is due within 30 days of commencement and years 2 and 3 are billed at the start of each year [Contract, 2.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: ...due at the beginning of each respective contract year]. Because the gap between payment and service transfer for each year is at most 12 months, the practical expedient applies and we need not adjust the transaction price for a significant financing component [ASC 606-10-32-15 to 32-16; ASC 606-10-32-18]. This conclusion is further consistent with the guidance that some upfront payment structures for services may be for reasons other than financing and therefore do not give rise to a significant financing component [ASC 606-10-32-17(c)].

Noncash consideration. None is specified; all consideration is denominated in cash amounts [Contract, Section 2.0 Fees and Payment Schedule]. Consideration payable to a customer. None is specified in the contract. The “Bundle Discount” indicates the contract prices already reflect a 10% reduction versus list for hardware and services, while the SaaS is at standard rate [Contract, 2.5 Bundle Discount]. Because these are stated prices within the contract, they are part of fixed consideration, not separate variable consideration; the discount will be addressed in allocation (Step 4), not in determining the total consideration.

Total transaction price.

Fixed consideration: $845,000 ($720,000 SaaS + $50,000 hardware + $75,000 services).
Variable consideration: $0 or $30,000, subject to the constraint assessment.
Because variable consideration must be constrained if a significant reversal is probable, we will include $30,000 only if management concludes it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur based on the entity’s experience and the specific facts [ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-13].

Conclusion:

We conclude the fixed transaction price is $845,000, with additional variable consideration of $0 to $30,000 for the performance bonus subject to the constraint. No significant financing component adjustment is required due to payment timing being within one year of transfer for each service period [ASC 606-10-32-15 to 32-18; ASC 606-10-32-4]. Noncash consideration and consideration payable to the customer are not present.

Issues or Uncertainties:

Variable consideration constraint: Management must document whether including the $30,000 bonus is “probable” of not resulting in a significant reversal, considering dependence on the Customer’s operations and internal reporting [ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-13].
Prevailing interest rates and cash selling prices: Not specified in contract.
Sales taxes or other amounts excluded from the transaction price: Not specified in contract.
Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Analysis:

Performance obligations (POs) summarized from Step 2. Based on the contract, we conclude there are three distinct performance obligations to which consideration must be allocated:

SaaS access: a 3‑year subscription to Logi‑AI Suite for up to 500 users [Contract, "Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: A 3-year subscription license"].
Hardware: delivery of 200 OptiScan‑7 scanners with transfer of title and risk on delivery [Contract, "Title and risk of loss for the scanners transfer to the Customer upon delivery."].
Professional services: a one‑time implementation/system integration and on‑site training, completed upon written acceptance [Contract, "Professional Services: A one-time engagement... These services are considered complete upon Customer's written acceptance."].
Transaction price components. The contract specifies fixed consideration of $240,000 per year for the SaaS over 3 years (total $720,000), $50,000 for hardware, and $75,000 for professional services, plus variable consideration in the form of a one‑time $30,000 performance bonus contingent on achieving a 15% shipping cost reduction within 12 months [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule; Contract, "Performance Bonus"]. The contract also states a targeted price concession: "the total fees... reflect a 10% discount on the standard standalone list prices for the hardware and services. The SaaS license is priced at its standard standalone rate." [Contract, "Bundle Discount"].

SSP determination. ASC 606 requires allocating the transaction price on the basis of standalone selling prices (SSPs) at contract inception for each distinct good or service [ASC 606‑10‑32‑29; 32‑31]. If an SSP is not directly observable, it must be estimated using a method that achieves the allocation objective (for example, market assessment, expected cost plus, or residual when appropriate) [ASC 606‑10‑32‑33; 32‑35]. Because the contract explicitly states the SaaS is priced at its “standard standalone rate,” we view the SaaS SSP as likely observable at $240,000 per year, subject to validation with pricing data. The hardware and services have “standard standalone list prices,” but those prices and any customary discounting practices are Not specified in contract; management should substantiate their SSPs using observable sales or appropriate estimation methods consistent with ASC 606‑10‑32‑31 to 32‑35.

Allocation methodology. We will allocate the transaction price to the three POs on a relative SSP basis at contract inception [ASC 606‑10‑32‑29; 32‑31]. Because the contract identifies a discount that applies only to certain items, discount allocation must be assessed. ASC 606 permits allocating a discount entirely to one or more (but not all) POs if the facts demonstrate the discount relates specifically to those POs and the criteria are met; otherwise, the discount is allocated proportionately across all POs with the relative SSP method [ASC 606‑10‑32‑37; 32‑36; 55‑262]. Here, the contract states the “10% discount” applies to the hardware and professional services, and “The SaaS license is priced at its standard standalone rate.” [Contract, "Bundle Discount"]. Because the contract expressly ties the discount to the hardware and services and indicates no discount on the SaaS, we will allocate the discount entirely to the hardware and services POs, and not to the SaaS PO, provided the entity’s customary pricing evidence supports that those goods/services are sold separately and the discount relates specifically to them (ASC 606 discount‑allocation criteria) [ASC 606‑10‑32‑37]. If those criteria are not fully met, the discount would instead be allocated proportionately to all POs using relative SSPs [ASC 606‑10‑32‑36; 55‑262].

Variable consideration. The $30,000 performance bonus is variable consideration. Inclusion in the transaction price and any specific‑PO allocation will be determined in Step 3 and then allocated in Step 4 consistent with ASC 606’s allocation objective. The contract does not specify that the bonus relates solely to one PO; therefore, unless evidence shows it relates specifically to a particular PO, the default is allocation on a relative SSP basis. Not specified in contract whether the bonus relates specifically to any single PO.

Final allocation approach (subject to SSP determination and Step 3 variable consideration conclusions):

Identify SSPs for each PO at contract inception. SaaS: validate $240,000 per year as observable SSP. Hardware and services: determine SSPs from observable sales or estimate per ASC 606 [ASC 606‑10‑32‑31 to 32‑35].
Determine the transaction price to be allocated: fixed consideration of $845,000 plus any Step 3‑included amount of the $30,000 bonus.
Allocate the contractual “bundle discount” entirely to the hardware and services POs (and not to SaaS), because the contract states the discount applies only to those items and SaaS is at its standard standalone rate [Contract, "Bundle Discount"; ASC 606‑10‑32‑37]. If criteria are not met, allocate the discount proportionately on relative SSPs [ASC 606‑10‑32‑36; 55‑262].
Allocate the resulting transaction price to the POs on a relative SSP basis consistently with ASC 606’s allocation objective [ASC 606‑10‑32‑29; 32‑31]. If any SSPs are highly variable or uncertain, consider a residual approach for those items in combination with other methods, ensuring the allocation objective is still met [ASC 606‑10‑32‑35; 55‑266].
Because the contract explicitly assigns the discount to hardware and services and indicates SaaS is at its standalone rate, allocating the discount only to those POs best reflects the consideration that the entity expects for transferring each distinct good or service, consistent with ASC 606’s allocation objective [ASC 606‑10‑32‑29; 32‑31; 32‑37].

Conclusion:

We will allocate the transaction price to the three POs—SaaS access, hardware delivery, and professional services—based on their relative SSPs at contract inception [ASC 606‑10‑32‑29; 32‑31]. Because the contract states the “10% discount” applies only to hardware and services and SaaS is at its standard standalone rate, we will allocate the discount entirely to the hardware and services POs, not to SaaS, provided the ASC 606 discount allocation criteria are satisfied [Contract, "Bundle Discount"; ASC 606‑10‑32‑37; 32‑36].

Issues or Uncertainties:

SSPs for hardware and professional services are Not specified in contract and must be substantiated with observable data or estimated per ASC 606 [ASC 606‑10‑32‑33; 32‑35].
Confirmation that ASC 606 criteria to allocate a discount entirely to specific POs are met (i.e., evidence the discount specifically relates to hardware/services and those items are sold separately at observable SSPs) [ASC 606‑10‑32‑37].
Variable consideration (the $30,000 performance bonus) inclusion and any specific‑PO relationship are Not specified in contract and will affect allocation if included (to be resolved in Step 3).
The 30‑day termination‑for‑convenience clause may affect contract term and transaction price considerations; any impact on SSP assessment or allocation will need evaluation.
Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Analysis:

We analyze revenue recognition for each identified performance obligation: (1) SaaS subscription to the Logi-AI Suite, (2) sale of 200 OptiScan-7 scanners, and (3) one-time professional services for implementation, integration, and training. We also address the contingent performance bonus. We apply ASC 606’s core principle to recognize revenue when (or as) control transfers to the customer [ASC 606-10-25-23], evaluating over-time criteria in ASC 606-10-25-27 and, if those are not met, point-in-time indicators in ASC 606-10-25-30.

1) Logi-AI Suite SaaS License (3-year subscription)

Pattern (over time). We conclude revenue is recognized over time because the SaaS subscription is a stand‑ready service the customer simultaneously receives and consumes as access is provided. The SOW describes a “3-year subscription license… includ[ing] standard support and maintenance, with monthly feature updates” [Contract, “Logi-AI Suite SaaS License”]. Because the customer receives and consumes benefits as the service is provided, criterion (a) in ASC 606-10-25-27 is met (“simultaneously receives and consumes”).
Transfer of control. Control of a hosted service is conveyed continuously through access, not at a point in time. Because the service is stand-ready and consumed as provided, control transfers over time [ASC 606-10-25-23, 25-27(a)].
Timing. Revenue is recognized ratably over the service period (time-elapsed measure) because the performance obligation is a stand‑ready obligation delivered evenly over time, and a time-based measure best depicts progress toward satisfaction [ASC 606-10-25-27]. The SOW states the term is 36 months starting on the Effective Date and is terminable for convenience on 30 days’ notice [Contract, “Term… 36 months… terminated for convenience with a 30-day notice”]. Because the service is provided continuously, we recognize revenue as each day of service is provided. If the contract is terminated early, revenue is recognized only for service provided up to termination. Invoicing (for example, “$240,000 per year… due… Net 30 from the Effective Date” and subsequent annual billings) does not affect the recognition pattern; billings in advance create a contract liability until the service is delivered [Contract, “SaaS License: $240,000 per year… due Net 30”].
Measurement method for over-time recognition: A time-elapsed method (e.g., straight-line over the access period) is appropriate because the service is stand‑ready and provided uniformly over time [ASC 606-10-25-27]. Specific metering of usage is not required or specified. Chosen practical expedient: Not specified in contract.

2) Hardware Provisioning (200 OptiScan-7 scanners)

Pattern (point in time). We conclude revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery, because the SOW states “Title and risk of loss for the scanners transfer to the Customer upon delivery” [Contract, “Title and risk of loss… transfer… upon delivery”].
Transfer of control. Legal title transfer and transfer of risk of loss are strong indicators of control transfer at delivery under ASC 606-10-25-30 (indicators include legal title, physical possession, and risks and rewards). The acceptance criteria also include successful delivery of all scanners [Contract, “Successful delivery of all 200 OptiScan-7 scanners…”], which corroborates the delivery-based transfer of control.
Timing. Recognize revenue when the scanners are delivered to the customer’s designated facility and title and risk pass [ASC 606-10-25-30]. Any shipping or handling after control transfers could be treated as fulfillment activities if the policy election is made and applied consistently [ASC 606-10-25-18B] (Not specified in contract).
3) Professional Services (implementation, integration, on‑site training; acceptance upon sign‑off)

Pattern (over time). We conclude revenue is recognized over time under ASC 606-10-25-27(b) because the services “significantly enhance [Logi-AI’s] core functionality by connecting directly to the Customer’s ERP system,” which constitutes creating or enhancing an asset the customer controls as it is created (the customer’s ERP/system environment) [Contract, “connecting directly to the Customer’s ERP system”]. Because the work is performed on and enhances the customer’s systems, the customer controls the asset as it is enhanced; therefore, control transfers over time.
Acceptance clause. The services are “considered complete upon Customer’s written acceptance” [Contract, “considered complete upon Customer’s written acceptance”]. Because criterion (b) for over-time recognition is met, written acceptance evidences completion but does not defer recognition if a faithful measure of progress is used and acceptance represents confirmation rather than transfer of control. If management determines criterion (b) is not met (e.g., the services do not enhance an asset the customer controls as performed), then revenue would be recognized at a point in time upon customer acceptance (an indicator of control transfer) under ASC 606-10-25-30.
Timing. Recognize revenue over the service period as progress is made. The services are expected to be completed within 60 days [Contract, “Professional Services: To be completed within 60 days”], but revenue is recognized based on progress, not schedule.
Measurement method for over‑time recognition. An input method such as costs or hours incurred relative to total expected inputs can faithfully depict performance, or an appropriate output method (e.g., milestones) if such outputs reflect value to the customer [ASC 606-10-25-27]. Specific method: Not specified in contract.
4) Performance Bonus ($30,000 contingent on 15% shipping cost reduction in first 12 months)

Nature. This is variable consideration contingent on an outcome “within the first 12 months of platform use,” measured by the customer’s reporting [Contract, “eligible for a one-time $30,000 performance bonus if the Customer achieves a… 15% reduction… within the first 12 months”].
Recognition timing. Under ASC 606, variable consideration is estimated (most likely amount is generally appropriate for a binary bonus) and included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved [ASC 606-10-32-8, 32-11, 32-12]. Because the bonus is linked to the customer’s realized cost reductions over the first 12 months of platform use, if the bonus is allocated to the SaaS service in that 12‑month period (Not specified in contract), revenue for the bonus would be recognized over that period to the extent not constrained; otherwise, recognition occurs when the outcome is resolved (i.e., when achievement is confirmed) to avoid potential reversal [ASC 606-10-32-11, 32-12].
Evidence. The SOW notes an 80% historical success rate for similar customers [Contract, “history of achieving this metric with 80% of its customers of a similar size”], which may support an estimate under the “most likely amount” method. However, whether inclusion is constrained requires broader evidence beyond the contract. If constrained, recognize the $30,000 only when achievement is confirmed within the 12‑month window.
Because…

SaaS is a stand‑ready service consumed as delivered; criterion (a) for over‑time is met [ASC 606-10-25-27(a)].
Hardware transfers control when title and risk pass at delivery; indicators of control transfer are present; therefore, point-in-time recognition at delivery is appropriate [ASC 606-10-25-30].
Integration services enhance the customer’s ERP environment that the customer controls, satisfying over‑time criterion (b); hence, recognize as progress occurs [ASC 606-10-25-27(b)].
The performance bonus is variable consideration; revenue is recognized only to the extent it is not constrained by a risk of significant reversal, which generally means upon resolution unless sufficient evidence supports recognition earlier [ASC 606-10-32-11, 32-12].
Conclusion:

SaaS subscription: Recognize revenue over time on a time‑elapsed basis over the service period (stand‑ready access), with daily/straight‑line recognition and adjustment for any early termination [ASC 606-10-25-23, 25-27].
Hardware scanners: Recognize revenue at a point in time upon delivery when title and risk pass and delivery acceptance is achieved [ASC 606-10-25-30].
Professional services: Recognize revenue over time using a faithful measure of progress (e.g., input method), because the work enhances an asset the customer controls (the customer’s ERP/integration) [ASC 606-10-25-27(b)]. The $30,000 performance bonus is variable consideration recognized only to the extent not constrained, typically upon confirmation of the 12‑month cost‑reduction outcome unless earlier recognition is supported [ASC 606-10-32-11, 32-12].
Issues or Uncertainties:

Allocation and linkage of the performance bonus to specific performance obligations or periods: Not specified in contract. This affects whether any portion could be recognized over the first 12 months versus only upon outcome confirmation.
Whether the professional services unequivocally meet ASC 606-10-25-27(b) (enhancing an asset the customer controls as created): While integration “connect[s] directly to the Customer’s ERP system,” operational details are not provided; if criterion (b) is not met, recognition would be at customer acceptance (point in time).
Choice of measure of progress for professional services (input vs output) and practical expedients for SaaS (e.g., time-based straight line): Not specified in contract.
Shipping and handling policy election for any post‑control activities (if applicable): Not specified in contract.
Termination for convenience (30-day notice) may affect the enforceable period assessed elsewhere; however, it does not change the over‑time nature of SaaS and may affect the period over which revenue is recognized if terminated early [ASC 606-10-25-23, 25-27].
