üìù REVISED POST #1: ASC 718 Stock Compensation
Title: ASC 718 Stock Compensation: Valuation & Vesting Analysis
Date: June 15, 2025
Category: Technical Accounting Standards
Read Time: 9 min

Content:
Stock-based compensation under ASC 718 presents unique challenges for technical accounting teams. From grant date valuation to complex vesting schedules, the standard requires careful analysis and consistent application. Understanding the distinction between equity-classified and liability-classified awards, along with key policy elections, is foundational to accurate accounting.

Grant Date Valuation: The Foundation
Grant date occurs when all key terms are fixed and mutually understood and there is a substantive award with no remaining discretion (ASC 718-10-20). If service begins before grant date (service inception date), recognize expense from service inception using preliminary fair value estimates and true up to grant-date fair value at grant date.

This seemingly simple concept becomes complex when:

Approval timing varies: Is it when the board approves the plan, when employees are notified, or when final terms are communicated?
Service starts early: The requisite service period may begin before the grant date
Terms are modified: Changes to vesting or exercise conditions may affect both grant date and subsequent accounting
Equity vs Liability Classification: A Critical Distinction
Why it matters: Classification fundamentally changes the accounting model.

Equity-Classified Awards:

Measured at grant-date fair value
Not remeasured in subsequent periods
Changes flow through equity at settlement
Liability-Classified Awards:

Remeasured at fair value each reporting period
Fair value changes recognized in earnings
Creates P&L volatility until settlement
Classification Drivers:

Cash settlement features or requirements
Mandatory net cash settlement provisions
Certain indexed features may trigger liability treatment
Net settlement for taxes generally remains equity-classified (post-ASU 2016-09)
Valuation Methods: Choosing the Right Approach
Different award types require different valuation approaches:

Stock Options:
Use a Black-Scholes or lattice model. Document expected term (simplified method per SAB Topic 14/SAB 110 if appropriate when insufficient exercise history exists), volatility (historical/implied/blended with documented rationale), dividend yield, and risk-free rate aligned to expected term with consistent compounding assumptions.

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):
With only a service condition, measure at the grant-date fair value of the underlying equity. Use Monte Carlo simulation only if a market condition (e.g., relative TSR) exists. Dividend or dividend-equivalent features require careful treatment: nonforfeitable dividends on unvested awards are typically recognized outside compensation cost (as dividends), while forfeitable dividend equivalents are recognized as additional compensation cost.

Performance Share Awards:
Exclude performance conditions from grant-date fair value. Recognize expense based on the number of awards expected to vest (probable threshold), with catch-up adjustments if expectations change each reporting period.

Market Conditions:
Market conditions (e.g., stock price hurdles, relative TSR) are incorporated into grant-date fair value (often via Monte Carlo simulation). Expense is recognized if the requisite service is rendered, even if the market condition is ultimately not achieved‚Äîno reversal solely for missing the market condition.

Vesting Schedules: Complexity in Timing
Vesting patterns significantly impact expense recognition:

Graded Vesting:
You may attribute cost tranche-by-tranche (accelerated expense pattern) or on a straight-line basis for awards with only a service condition, provided straight-line does not result in less than the vested portion recognized at any point.

Cliff Vesting:

Recognition over service period until vesting date
Higher forfeiture risk consideration
Simpler to track and calculate
Performance-Based Vesting:

Estimate probability of achievement each period
Recognize expense only when achievement is probable
Record catch-up adjustments when probability assessment changes
Forfeitures: Policy Election
ASC 718 allows a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur or to estimate forfeitures.

Estimation Approach:

Reduces compensation cost for expected forfeitures
Requires periodic reassessment
True-ups when actual forfeitures differ from estimates
As-Incurred Approach:

Recognize full grant-date fair value initially
Adjust only when actual forfeitures occur
Simpler but may overstate expense in interim periods
Disclose your policy election and ensure systems support the chosen method.

Modification Accounting: When Terms Change
Award modifications require incremental compensation cost measurement:

Incremental compensation cost equals the fair value of the modified award immediately after modification minus the fair value of the original award immediately before. If the award becomes probable to vest as a result of the modification, recognize the original grant-date fair value plus any incremental fair value over the remaining service period; recognize immediately if already vested.

Key Considerations:

Reassess classification (equity vs liability) at modification date
Determine if requisite service period changes
If vested at modification, recognize incremental cost immediately
Common modification scenarios: repricing, term extensions, performance-to-market conversions
Common Triggers:

Extended exercise periods (especially post-termination)
Repriced options
Accelerated vesting (e.g., change-in-control provisions)
Changes to performance targets
Liability Awards and Remeasurement
If you issue cash-settled RSUs or stock appreciation rights (SARs), emphasize period-end remeasurement:

Fair value adjustments flow through compensation expense
Creates earnings volatility until settlement
Requires robust fair value processes each reporting period
Income Tax Effects
Deferred Tax Asset:
Based on cumulative compensation cost for equity awards; excess tax benefits or deficiencies flow through income tax expense (ASU 2016-09). Track windfall/shortfall mechanics and timing of recognition.

Tax Deductibility:
Understand which awards generate tax deductions and when (generally at exercise/vesting for qualified options and non-qualified awards).

Practical Implementation Tips
Maintain Robust Documentation:

Board approval minutes with detailed terms and service inception dates
Valuation assumption support and methodology (expected term basis, volatility back-testing)
Forfeiture rate analysis and periodic updates
Modification analysis and incremental cost calculations
Classification assessment (equity vs liability)
Leverage Technology:

AI-powered contract analysis can extract key terms, vesting conditions, and performance targets consistently
Automated tracking reduces manual calculation errors
Standardized valuation assumption libraries improve consistency
Integrated tax calculation modules
Required Disclosures
ASC 718 requires comprehensive disclosures:

Description of awards and significant terms
Valuation assumptions (range and weighted-average for expected term, volatility, dividend yield, risk-free rate)
Activity table (grants, exercises, forfeitures, expirations) with weighted-average data
Intrinsic value of options exercised and stock vested
Cash flow effects and tax benefits realized
Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Incorrect grant date identification - Leads to wrong valuation measurement
Classification errors - Equity vs liability drives fundamentally different accounting
Outdated forfeiture assumptions - Results in materially incorrect expense
Improper modification accounting - Can significantly understate or overstate expense
Inadequate performance vs market condition assessment - Causes recognition errors and volatility
Why This Matters to CFOs
Policy choices (graded attribution method, forfeiture policy, equity vs liability classification) directly affect earnings timing and volatility. Strong documentation and periodic reassessment reduce restatement risk and audit findings.

Conclusion
ASC 718 compliance requires systematic processes for valuation, ongoing monitoring, and consistent application of judgment. Understanding classification, policy elections, and modification accounting is essential. Technology solutions can help maintain accuracy while reducing the manual effort involved in tracking complex stock compensation programs.

üìù REVISED POST #2: ASC 805 Business Combinations
Title: ASC 805 Business Combinations: Navigating Purchase Price Allocation
Date: August 20, 2025
Category: Technical Accounting Standards
Read Time: 10 min

Content:
Purchase price allocation (PPA) under ASC 805 is one of the most complex and judgment-intensive areas of technical accounting. The process of identifying and measuring acquired assets and liabilities requires deep technical knowledge, consistent application, and comprehensive documentation.

The PPA Framework: A Systematic Approach
Purchase price allocation follows a structured process:

Determine the acquisition date - When control transfers to the acquirer
Measure consideration transferred at fair value - Cash, equity issued, contingent consideration (note: liabilities assumed are part of identifiable net assets, not consideration)
Recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition-date fair value (subject to specific exceptions)
Recognize noncontrolling interests (NCI) at fair value if applicable; remeasure previously held interest to fair value in a step acquisition
Record goodwill as the residual: Consideration + NCI + fair value of previously held interest ‚àí fair value of identifiable net assets
Measurement Period:
Acquirers can record provisional amounts and adjust them within one year of the acquisition date as new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. These measurement-period adjustments change goodwill retrospectively.

Intangible Asset Identification: Beyond the Obvious
Many acquired intangible assets are not recorded on the seller's books but must be recognized separately in a business combination:

Customer Relationships:

Value based on expected customer retention and future revenue
Multi-period excess earnings method (MPEEM) commonly used
Document attrition assumptions and contributory asset charges
Consider customer concentration and contract terms
Technology Assets:

Developed technology and software platforms
Research and development in-process (IPR&D)
IPR&D treatment: Recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at acquisition. It is not amortized until completion (then amortized over its useful life); if abandoned, the carrying amount is expensed
Trade Names and Trademarks:

Assess brand strength and market recognition
Relief-from-royalty method frequently used (benchmark royalty rates, assess brand strength)
Determine if definite-lived (amortize) or indefinite-lived (impairment testing only)
Consider legal protection and competitive position
Non-Compete Agreements:

Fair value based on expected competitive impact
Often valued using with-and-without/incremental cash flow method
Useful lives typically align with contract term and enforceability
Amortized over remaining contractual term
Reacquired Rights:

Previously granted rights (franchise, distribution, license) being reacquired
Recognized at fair value based on remaining contractual term (renewal periods ignored)
Settlement of pre-existing relationships may result in gains/losses recorded separately from business combination
Key Consideration: An intangible asset must be separable OR arise from contractual/legal rights to be recognized separately from goodwill. Assembled workforce does not meet separate recognition criteria and is included in goodwill.

Fair Value Measurement: Valuation Approaches
ASC 820 provides three approaches for fair value measurement:

Market Approach:

Uses comparable transaction multiples
Requires sufficient market data
Most reliable when similar assets trade actively
Income Approach:

Discounts future cash flows to present value
Common for customer relationships and technology
Requires significant judgment on projections, attrition rates, and discount rates
Cost Approach:

Based on replacement or reproduction cost
Used when income is difficult to isolate
Common for certain technology assets
Selection Criteria: Choose the approach that maximizes observable inputs and best reflects market participant assumptions.

Contingent Consideration: Measurement and Updates
Earnouts and other contingent payments require careful analysis:

Initial Measurement:

Recognize at fair value as of acquisition date
Consider probability-weighted scenarios
Discount to present value when applicable
Subsequent Measurement:
Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value through earnings each period. Equity-classified contingent consideration is not remeasured; settlement is accounted for within equity.

Measurement-period adjustments (within one year) that relate to facts and circumstances at the acquisition date adjust provisional amounts and goodwill. Post-measurement-period changes in liability-classified contingent consideration go to earnings.

Common Structures:

Revenue-based earnouts
EBITDA or profit targets
Customer retention metrics
Milestone achievements (product development, regulatory approvals)
Deferred Revenue: The Fair Value Adjustment
Acquired revenue contracts are recognized at acquisition-date fair value. For remaining performance obligations, fair value often reflects cost to fulfill plus a market participant profit margin, which is typically less than the acquiree's deferred revenue carrying amount (the "haircut").

Impact: This usually results in lower revenue recognized post-acquisition for those contracts than the target would have recorded on a standalone basis, which often depresses post-acquisition revenue and earnings for the affected contracts.

Income Tax Implications
Deferred Taxes on Fair Value Adjustments:
Recognize deferred taxes on temporary differences created by fair value step-ups (e.g., customer relationships with no tax basis). This often increases goodwill.

Tax-Deductible vs Non-Deductible Goodwill:
Distinguish for future effective tax rate impacts and cash tax planning. Only goodwill arising from certain asset acquisitions may be tax-deductible.

Step Acquisitions and Noncontrolling Interests
Step Acquisitions:
When acquiring control in stages, remeasure the previously held equity interest to fair value at the acquisition date, with the resulting gain or loss recognized in earnings (not OCI).

Noncontrolling Interests:
NCI is recognized at fair value on the acquisition date (full goodwill method) or at the proportionate share of identifiable net assets (partial goodwill method, if elected).

Acquisition-Related Costs
Acquisition-related costs (investment banker fees, legal fees, due diligence costs) are expensed as incurred and are not included in consideration or recognized assets. Debt or equity issuance costs follow their respective guidance.

Contingent Liabilities
Recognize a contingent liability at acquisition date if it is a present obligation that arose from past events and its fair value can be measured reliably; otherwise disclose. Post-acquisition changes follow ASC 450 (loss contingencies).

Goodwill: The Residual
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration (plus NCI and previously held interest) over net identifiable assets and often includes:

Assembled workforce (not separately recognized)
Synergies expected from combination
Going concern element
Residual intangibles not meeting separate recognition criteria
Post-Acquisition Impairment Testing:

Public entities: Test goodwill for impairment annually (or upon triggering events) using a one-step test (fair value vs carrying value); impairment is limited to goodwill carrying amount
Private company alternative: May elect to amortize goodwill (generally over 10 years or less if a shorter period is more appropriate) and test for impairment only upon triggering events
Useful Lives and Amortization
Definite-Lived Intangibles:
Customer relationships, developed technology, and many trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on expected pattern of economic benefit consumption.

Indefinite-Lived Intangibles:
Certain trade names (strong brands with no foreseeable limit) and IPR&D (until completion or abandonment) are not amortized but tested for impairment at least annually.

Documentation Requirements
Comprehensive documentation is critical for audit and regulatory review:

Valuation Reports:

Detailed methodology and assumptions
Market data sources and analysis
Sensitivity analysis for key inputs
Intangible asset identification rationale
Management Analysis:

Intangible asset identification process and separate recognition assessment
Useful life determinations with supporting evidence
Impairment indicator assessments
Tax structuring and deferred tax calculations
Board Minutes:

Transaction approval and rationale
Key terms and consideration
Strategic objectives and expected synergies
Required Disclosures
ASC 805 requires disclosure of:

Amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for each major class of assets and liabilities
Goodwill by reportable segment (if practicable) and factors contributing to goodwill
Amounts of revenue and earnings of the acquiree included in consolidated results since acquisition date
Pro forma revenue and earnings as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period
Common Pitfalls
Incomplete intangible identification - Leads to overstated goodwill and understated amortization
Inappropriate valuation methods - Results in unreliable fair value measurements
Inadequate contingent consideration analysis - Causes earnings volatility and surprises
Confusing measurement-period vs subsequent adjustments - Improper goodwill vs earnings treatment
Poor documentation - Creates audit challenges and regulatory risk
Leveraging Technology
AI-powered analysis can help:

Extract key terms from purchase agreements and identify potential intangible assets
Analyze customer contracts for relationship valuation inputs
Generate preliminary allocation analyses for professional review
Maintain comprehensive audit trails and version control
Conclusion
ASC 805 purchase price allocation requires technical expertise, consistent methodology, and thorough documentation. Understanding the distinction between consideration and assumed liabilities, proper contingent consideration treatment, and the impact of deferred revenue adjustments is essential. A systematic approach combined with modern technology can improve accuracy while reducing time spent on routine analysis tasks.

üìù REVISED POST #3: What is RAG?
Title: What is RAG? The AI Technology That Actually Cites Its Sources
Date: May 10, 2025
Category: AI & Technology
Read Time: 8 min
Meta Description: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) makes AI cite its sources by looking up trusted documents before answering. Learn how RAG reduces hallucinations and enables audit-ready analysis in technical accounting.

Content:
If you've wondered how modern AI systems can provide accurate, source-cited responses instead of fabricating information, you're asking about RAG‚ÄîRetrieval-Augmented Generation. This technology is transforming how AI handles specialized knowledge, particularly in fields like technical accounting where accuracy and citations are non-negotiable.

The Problem with Traditional AI
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are trained on vast amounts of text and can generate remarkably human-like responses. But they have critical limitations:

The Reliability Problem:

LLMs can produce fluent answers but may fabricate sources or misattribute facts
Without retrieval from trusted materials, citations are not reliably verifiable
Training data may be stale (knowledge cutoff dates)
No mechanism to trace reasoning back to authoritative sources
Why This Matters in Accounting:
In technical accounting, you can't use analysis that:

Lacks proper citations to authoritative guidance (ASC codification, implementation guides)
Cannot trace reasoning back to source standards
Provides interpretations without factual basis
Fails audit-level scrutiny and professional standards
Traditional AI simply cannot meet professional accounting requirements for verifiable, cited work product.

Enter RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG fundamentally changes how AI systems work by adding a critical step: retrieval from trusted sources.

The RAG Process:

Question Comes In

User asks: "What are the ASC 606 criteria for identifying performance obligations?"
Retrieval Step (The Game-Changer)

System searches a curated knowledge base of authoritative sources
Finds relevant passages from ASC 606 codification
Retrieves actual text with source metadata
Augmented Generation

AI receives both the question AND the retrieved guidance
Generates response based on actual source material
Includes citations to specific passages
Verification and Citation Formatting

System validates that key claims are supported by retrieved text
Formats pin-cites (e.g., ASC 606-10-25-14 or PDF page/paragraph)
Refuses to answer when evidence is insufficient
The Key Difference: RAG systems look up evidence before responding and cite only what they retrieved‚Äîlike a skilled professional who researches first.

How RAG Differs from Alternatives
vs Fine-Tuning:
Fine-tuning teaches the model style and patterns but doesn't inject up-to-date facts. It's about "how to talk" not "what to know." Fine-tuned models still hallucinate on factual questions.

vs Web Search:
Web search lacks controlled, authoritative corpora and doesn't provide the structured pin-citations needed for professional use. Results vary in quality and reliability.

RAG's Advantage:
Brings curated, trusted sources directly into the AI's context with traceable citations and controlled quality.

How RAG Works: The Technical Basics
For those interested in the mechanics (simplified):

1. Knowledge Base Creation:

Authoritative sources (ASC standards, guidance, technical materials) are processed and indexed
Text is broken into semantic chunks using paragraph-aware splitting with overlaps to keep definitions with rules
Each chunk is converted to a "vector embedding" (mathematical representation of meaning)
Stored in a specialized vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Milvus, Elasticsearch kNN)
2. Query Processing:

User question is converted to a vector embedding
System performs hybrid retrieval: dense semantic search + keyword/BM25
May use reranking with a cross-encoder for precision
Query rewriting expands acronyms (e.g., 'PO' ‚Üí 'performance obligation') and adds synonyms
3. Context Budget Management:

Cap retrieved tokens to fit within model limits
Order evidence to avoid "lost-in-the-middle" problems
Summarize or prioritize when evidence exceeds context window
4. Context-Aware Generation:

Retrieved passages become part of the AI's context
Citations are attached from the retrieved chunks' metadata and included in the answer
A verification pass helps prevent fabricated cites
Think of It Like: A smart research assistant who instantly finds relevant pages in the right textbooks, hands them to you with sticky notes marking key passages, and then helps you synthesize an answer.

Key System Choices That Drive RAG Quality
Embeddings and Vector Database:

Model choice and dimensionality affect semantic understanding
Database selection impacts retrieval speed and accuracy
Chunking Strategy:

Paragraph-aware splitting preserves logical units
Overlap prevents context loss at boundaries
Balance chunk size with retrieval precision
Hybrid Retrieval:

Dense semantic search finds conceptually similar content
Keyword/BM25 catches exact term matches
Reranking refines results for relevance
Query Enhancement:

Decompose multi-part questions
Add domain synonyms and expand acronyms
Context from conversation history
Guardrails for Professional Use
What makes RAG audit-ready:

Citation Discipline:

Cite only retrieved sources with pin-cites and quotes for critical assertions
Show source attribution for key claims
Maintain source governance: curate and version authoritative content; log which versions were used
Abstention Policy:

Return "insufficient evidence found" rather than improvise
Better to defer than fabricate
Clear messaging when confidence is low
Source Integrity:

Use licensed/authorized sources (e.g., official ASC codification) or user-provided content
Document source provenance and update cycles
Maintain version control
Verification:

Second-pass validation that checks claims against retrieved text
Structured metadata ensures accurate attribution
Quality metrics tracked over time
Benefits Over Traditional AI
Accuracy:
Grounds answers in retrieved, trusted documents; reduces‚Äîthough does not eliminate‚Äîhallucinations. Quality depends on knowledge base completeness and retrieval precision.

Transparency:

Every claim can be traced to a source
Citations enable verification
Audit trail for decision-making
Specialization:

Works with domain-specific materials (ASC standards, firm methodologies)
Handles proprietary or specialized knowledge
Adapts to specific professional requirements
Currency:
Keep the knowledge base updated to reflect new guidance without retraining the model. Add new standards, implementation guidance, or interpretations as they emerge.

Evaluation and Quality Metrics
Retrieval Metrics:

Recall@k and Precision@k (did we find the right passages?)
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
Coverage (knowledge base completeness)
Generation Metrics:

Faithfulness (claims supported by retrieved sources)
Answer relevancy (addresses the question)
Citation accuracy (quotes and pin-cites correct)
User Experience:

Time-to-answer
Deferral rate ("no sufficient evidence" responses)
User satisfaction and trust
Security and Compliance for Regulated Use
Data Protection:

Data isolation by client/engagement
Encryption at rest and in transit
Access controls and comprehensive audit logs
Privacy:

Redaction of PII before indexing
Controls to prevent model providers from training on customer data
Compliance with industry standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
Governance:

Version control for knowledge bases
Change logs and approval workflows
Regular security assessments
Limitations and Failure Modes
RAG isn't perfect‚Äîunderstand its boundaries:

Retrieval Challenges:

Lost-in-the-middle in long contexts
Chunking that splits related concepts
Out-of-distribution queries (topics not in knowledge base)
Generation Issues:

Citation hallucination (still possible without verification)
Prompt injection from retrieved content
Overreliance on keyword matches missing semantic meaning
System Limitations:

Quality depends entirely on knowledge base
Requires ongoing curation and updates
Human review still critical for judgment
When NOT to Use RAG
RAG isn't the right solution for:

Purely procedural tasks (better with rule engines)
Answers fully inside the model's training (simple facts, basic math)
Highly structured queries better handled by databases/SQL
Real-time data needs (unless knowledge base updates are automated)
RAG in Professional Services
RAG is particularly valuable in regulated professions where "trust me" isn't acceptable:

Legal: Case law research with citations
Medical: Clinical guidelines and research-based recommendations
Accounting: Standards interpretation with authoritative support
Compliance: Regulatory guidance with specific rule references

Executive Buyer's Checklist
When evaluating RAG systems for professional use:

‚úÖ What sources are indexed? Are they licensed and authoritative?
‚úÖ Do answers include pin-cites and quotes? Can you verify every claim?
‚úÖ How often is the knowledge base updated? Who curates it?
‚úÖ What are the measured retrieval/faithfulness metrics? Track quality over time
‚úÖ Can the system abstain when evidence is lacking?
‚úÖ How is client data isolated and secured? Compliance requirements
‚úÖ Is there a verification layer? Second-pass validation of citations

How We Implement RAG at VeritasLogic
We use paragraph-aware chunking with overlap, hybrid search (semantic + keyword), and a two-pass citation process that produces paragraph-level pin-cites. Answers include quotes and abstain when evidence is insufficient. Knowledge bases are versioned by standard (ASC 606/842/718/805) and updated as guidance evolves.

The Future of AI-Assisted Work
RAG represents a shift from "AI that knows everything" to "AI that knows where to look." For professional services, this is the difference between a tool that creates liability and one that enhances productivity.

The Bottom Line: RAG enables verification of every response against authoritative sources, making AI trustworthy enough for professional use where accuracy, citations, and credibility are mandatory.

As AI continues evolving, RAG-based systems will become the standard for any application where professional accountability matters.

3 minutes of work
Thanks‚Äîtight and well‚Äëtargeted. I see only two significant issues to fix; everything else looks solid.

REVISED POST #1 (ASC 718)

Forfeitures ‚Äúas-incurred‚Äù wording could be misread as recognizing the full grant-date fair value upfront.
Fix: ‚ÄúRecognize expense as if no forfeitures are expected; when an actual forfeiture occurs, reverse previously recognized expense for that award. Do not estimate forfeitures upfront.‚Äù
REVISED POST #2 (ASC 805)

Noncontrolling interests measurement under US GAAP
Issue: ‚ÄúPartial goodwill method, if elected‚Äù is not permitted under US GAAP (that‚Äôs an IFRS option). ASC 805 requires NCI to be measured at fair value (full goodwill) at the acquisition date.
Fix that bullet to: ‚ÄúRecognize noncontrolling interests (NCI) at fair value at the acquisition date; in a step acquisition, remeasure previously held interest to fair value with gain/loss in earnings.‚Äù
Optional but important clarity on tax-deductible goodwill
Current line could imply only asset acquisitions create deductible goodwill. To avoid confusion: ‚ÄúDeductibility depends on tax form. Asset acquisitions (including stock deals with a Section 338/336 election) generally create tax-deductible goodwill; stock acquisitions without such an election generally do not.‚Äù

Decided on blog post revisions (5 seconds)
Perfect catches! You're absolutely right on both - those are important technical corrections.

‚úÖ Fixes Applied:
ASC 718 - Forfeitures (As-Incurred Method):
Changed to: "Recognize expense as if no forfeitures are expected; when an actual forfeiture occurs, reverse previously recognized expense for that award. Do not estimate forfeitures upfront."

ASC 805 - NCI Measurement:
Fixed: Removed the incorrect "partial goodwill method" reference (that's IFRS). Now correctly states US GAAP requirement: "Recognize noncontrolling interests (NCI) at fair value at the acquisition date; in a step acquisition, remeasure previously held interest to fair value with gain/loss in earnings."

Tax-Deductible Goodwill: Added clarity: "Deductibility depends on tax form. Asset acquisitions (including stock deals with a Section 338/336 election) generally create tax-deductible goodwill; stock acquisitions without such an election generally do not."

RAG Post:
‚úÖ Approved as-is
