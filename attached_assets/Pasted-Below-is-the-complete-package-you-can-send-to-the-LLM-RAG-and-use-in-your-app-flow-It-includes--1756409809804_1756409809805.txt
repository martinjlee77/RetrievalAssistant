Below is the complete package you can send to the LLM (RAG) and use in your app flow. It includes: (1) the 5-step ASC 842 instruction set with Focus and Key Points/citations, (2) a contract-data checklist by step to validate uploaded documents, and (3) a single consolidated user-input checklist.

5-step ASC 842 instruction set (for initial accounting)

Step 1: Scope, identify a lease, and determine the enforceable period and lease term Focus: Confirm the arrangement is (or contains) a lease and establish the enforceable period and lease term. Key points:

- A contract contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration [ASC 842-10-15-3; 842-10-15-9 through 15-16].
- Scope exclusions include leases of certain intangible assets, biological assets, and inventory [ASC 842-10-15-2].
- Enforceable period: a contract is no longer enforceable when both parties can terminate without more than an insignificant penalty; assess lease term only within the enforceable period [Master Glossary: Enforceable; Lease Term; Noncancellable].
- Substitution rights: if the supplier’s substitution right is substantive, the asset is not identified [ASC 842-10-15-9 through 15-14].
- Embedded derivatives may require bifurcation under ASC 815; the lease itself is not a derivative [ASC 815-10-15; 815-15].
- Lease term: noncancellable period plus periods covered by options to extend (if reasonably certain to exercise), options to terminate (if reasonably certain not to exercise), and specified lessor-controlled periods [Master Glossary: Lease Term; ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3; 842-10-55-23 through 55-26].
- Reassess lease term upon specified events (e.g., significant event/change in circumstances within the lessee’s control affecting option assessments) [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3].
- Both‑party termination rights generally cap the enforceable period at the earliest date either party can terminate without more than an insignificant penalty [Master Glossary: Enforceable].
- If only the lessee has a termination right, treat it as a lessee termination option when determining the lease term [ASC 842-10-55-24].

Step 2: Identify components and determine lease payments Focus: Separate lease vs nonlease components (or elect not to separate) and determine payments included in the lease liability. Key points:

- Identify lease components (right to use each underlying asset) and nonlease components (e.g., services, CAM); administrative tasks are not components [ASC 842-10-15-28 through 15-31].
- Allocation: If not electing the practical expedient, allocate consideration to components based on relative standalone prices [ASC 842-10-15-32 through 15-36].
- Practical expedient: By class of underlying asset, you may elect to not separate nonlease components; account for combined consideration as a single lease component [ASC 842-10-15-37 through 15-38].
- Ownership-level costs paid by the lessor (e.g., property taxes/insurance) that are reimbursed by the lessee are typically nonlease components unless in‑substance fixed lease payments [ASC 842-10-15-30].
- Include in lease payments: fixed payments (including in‑substance fixed), variable payments that depend on an index or a rate (measured using the index/rate at commencement), amounts probable under residual value guarantees, purchase option price if reasonably certain to exercise, and termination penalties consistent with lease‑term assessment; reduce for lease incentives receivable [ASC 842-20-30-5].
- Exclude usage/performance‑based variable payments that are not in‑substance fixed; expense as incurred [ASC 842-20-25].

Step 3: Classify the lease and measure at commencement Focus: Decide finance vs operating classification and measure the lease liability and ROU asset on the commencement date (using the user‑provided discount rate). Key points:

- Classification: Finance if any of the five criteria are met (transfer of ownership, reasonably certain purchase option, lease term is a major part of remaining economic life, PV of payments is substantially all of fair value, or no alternative use); otherwise operating [ASC 842-10-25-2].
- Classification is not reassessed after commencement unless certain modifications/remeasurements occur [ASC 842-10-25-8].
- Commencement date is when the asset is made available for use; measure and recognize at that date [ASC 842-10-55].
- Recognize a lease liability at the present value of lease payments (use the user‑provided rate) and an ROU asset measured as: lease liability + prepaid lease payments + initial direct costs – lease incentives received/receivable [ASC 842-20-25-1; 842-20-30-1; 842-20-30-5].
- Initial direct costs are narrowly defined as incremental costs that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained [Master Glossary; ASC 842-10-30].
- Include asset retirement obligations (if any) in the ROU asset per ASC 410 (not in the lease liability) [ASC 410; ASC 842-20-30-1].
- Short‑term lease policy: if elected and criteria met (12 months or less and no purchase option), do not recognize ROU asset/liability; recognize lease cost generally straight‑line [ASC 842-20-25-2].

Step 4: Produce initial accounting outputs Focus: Document and output the initial recognition, classification, calculations, and required notes. Key points:

- Provide classification conclusion and rationale with citations [ASC 842-10-25-2].
- Show the lease payments included in the liability by category and the present value calculation [ASC 842-20-30-5].
- Provide commencement‑date journal entries (ROU asset, lease liability, and any prepaid/incentive/initial direct cost effects) [ASC 842-20-25-1; 842-20-30-1].
- Identify initial presentation and disclosure data points (policy elections such as short‑term and non‑separation expedient; significant judgments such as “reasonably certain”) [ASC 842-20-45-1; 842-20-50-1].

Step 5: Reminders beyond initial recognition (no computations) Focus: Keep in view subsequent accounting, remeasurement triggers, modifications, subleases, and disclosures for later periods. Key points:

- Subsequent accounting: finance leases recognize interest on the liability and amortization of the ROU asset; operating leases recognize a single lease cost generally straight‑line; variable payments excluded from the liability are expensed when incurred [ASC 842-20-25; ASC 842-10-55-229].
- Remeasurement triggers: change in lease term or purchase option assessment; change in expected RVG amounts; resolution of contingencies that make payments fixed; modifications not accounted for as separate. Do not remeasure solely for changes in an index or a rate; under ASC 842 such changes are expensed as variable lease cost unless remeasurement is required for another reason [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3; 842-10-25-8 through 25-10].
- Modifications: assess whether separate contract; if not separate, remeasure, reallocate, and reassess classification [ASC 842-10-25-8 through 25-10].
- Subleases/assignments: a sublease creates an intermediate lessor; classify the sublease by reference to the head‑lease ROU asset; derecognize the head lease only upon legal release/novation (termination) [ASC 842-10 (Subleases); ASC 842-20-40].
- Presentation/disclosures: separate presentation (or disclosure) of operating vs finance ROU assets and lease liabilities, maturity analysis, lease cost components, and significant judgments [ASC 842-20-45-1; 842-20-50-1].

Contract data checklist by step (to validate a “real lease” before analysis)

Step 1 — Scope/lease identification/term
