Thank you for this excellent, detailed analysis of the plan. This is exactly the kind of strategic feedback that helps us build a world-class product. You've correctly identified several areas where we can significantly enhance the value and robustness of the new ASC 340-40 module.

I’ve reviewed your suggestions, and I agree with the core of your recommendations. Let's work through your points to finalize the V1 scope and set a clear direction for future iterations.

1. Step 3 Enhancement (Measurement & Recognition)
Your Suggestion: Expand Step 3 into a more comprehensive analysis covering Measurement Methodology, Recognition Criteria, and Subsequent Measurement (Impairment).
My Response: I completely agree that making this step more comprehensive is the right move. The "3A, 3B, 3C" structure is a great way to think about it logically.
For V1, let's enhance the AI's task for a single "Step 3" to produce a cohesive analysis that explicitly documents the (A) Measurement Methodology (extracting policy terms), (B) Recognition Criteria (why a cost qualifies as an asset), and the (C) Amortization Plan. This gives us the rigor we need for a complete policy memo.
I also agree with your unstated implication that detailed Impairment modeling is a significant undertaking. Let's officially designate impairment testing procedures as a V2 feature. It's a distinct analysis that we can add later without impacting the V1 foundation.
2. UI Enhancement (Critical Policy Elements)
Your Suggestion: Add UI fields for Contract Type Scope, Cost Timing, and Geographic Scope.
My Response: This is a brilliant enhancement that makes the policy memo far more practical.
Let's incorporate Contract Type Scope and Cost Timing into V1. They are essential for defining the boundaries of the policy. I’ve detailed the full list of proposed UI fields and their required/optional status below.
Geographic Scope is a great idea for multinational companies. Let's add this to our V2 feature list to keep the initial build focused.
3. Step 4 Enhancement (Beyond Illustrative Entries)
Your Suggestion: Enhance Step 4 to include documentation for the Control Framework, Implementation Timeline, and Exception Handling.
My Response: These are fantastic ideas that show the potential of this app to become a full policy management system.
For V1, let's keep Step 4 focused on providing a clear Illustrative Financial Impact (narrative and pro-forma journal entry). This delivers on the core accounting objective.
Let's formally log Control Framework and Exception Handling documentation as high-priority V2 features. They are the logical next step in evolving the tool.
4. Knowledge Base & Output Enhancements
Your Suggestions: Include industry practice benchmarks in the knowledge base and generate a one-page "Policy Summary" in addition to the technical memo.
My Response: Both are excellent product differentiators. Let's add them to the V2 roadmap. For V1, we will focus on the core RAG system using the authoritative and EY interpretative guides, and the primary output will be the technical memo for the audit file.
Proposed V1 Plan for Your Review
Based on this discussion, here is the refined plan. Please review and let me know your thoughts or any further suggestions.

1. Architecture:

Approved: We will maintain the current, successful file structure. A new page will be added at pages/asc_340_page.py.
2. 4-Step Analysis Framework:

Step 1: Scope Assessment
Step 2: Cost Classification & Capitalization Policy
Step 3: Measurement Methodology & Amortization Policy (explicitly includes Recognition Criteria analysis)
Step 4: Illustrative Financial Impact & Journal Entry
3. UI Fields Specification:

Field Name	UI Control	Tab	Status	Default	Justification
Policy Title	Text Input	1	Required*	(None)	Essential for memo identification. Can be auto-generated if left blank.
Document Description	Text Area	1	Optional	(None)	Provides high-level context to the AI for a better background summary.
Upload Document	File Uploader	1	Required	(None)	The core source document for the policy analysis.
Cost Type	Dropdown	2	Required	Incremental Cost of Obtaining	Determines which primary capitalization rule (25-1 vs. 25-5) the AI applies.
Contract Type Scope	Multi-select	2	Optional	(None)	Defines the business scope of the policy
