Subject: Product Update: Finalizing the Memo Results Page Layout

Hi [Developer's Name],

I've finalized the design for the memo results page. The goal is to prioritize the user's main actions (downloading/viewing the file) while also providing a convenient on-page preview. The layout should be clean and intuitive for our professional audience.

Here is the plan:

1. Simplify to Two Core Actions: We will offer two primary output options: * Download DOCX: For an editable "working file." * View in Browser: For a perfectly styled HTML version that can be easily viewed, shared, or printed to PDF. * (The direct PDF download option will be removed to simplify the app.)

2. New Page Layout: The results page should be structured as follows: * First, a clear "Memo Actions" container with the two buttons side-by-side. * Second, an optional, scrollable "Memo Preview" section below the buttons for users who wish to review the content directly on the page.

Here is the code reflecting the desired layout and functionality for the results display section:

# In the main 'else:' block for displaying results

# ... (header with title and 'Start New Analysis' button) ...

st.subheader("üìã ASC 606 Accounting Memo")

memo = getattr(analysis_results, 'professional_memo', None)

if memo:
    # --- 1. MEMO ACTIONS (Buttons First) ---
    with st.container(border=True):
        st.markdown("**Memo Actions**")
        st.write("Your analysis is complete. Choose an option below to view or download the memo.")

        dl_col1, dl_col2 = st.columns(2)

        # Generate the HTML content once to be used for both the link and the preview
        from utils.html_export import convert_memo_to_html, create_html_download_link
        html_content = convert_memo_to_html(memo, contract_data)

        # Column 1: The primary working file (DOCX Download)
        with dl_col1:
            from utils.llm import create_docx_from_text
            st.download_button(
                label="üìÑ Download DOCX",
                data=create_docx_from_text(memo, contract_data),
                file_name=f"{analysis_title}_ASC606_Memo.docx",
                mime="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
                use_container_width=True,
                help="Download the memo as an editable Word document."
            )

        # Column 2: The primary viewing file (HTML View)
        with dl_col2:
            data_url = create_html_download_link(html_content)
            st.link_button(
                label="üåê View in Browser",
                url=data_url,
                use_container_width=True,
                help="Opens the fully-styled memo in a new tab for easy viewing or printing to PDF."
            )

    # --- 2. OPTIONAL MEMO PREVIEW (Below the buttons) ---
    st.markdown("---") # Visual separator
    with st.expander("üìÑ Show Memo Preview", expanded=False):
        import streamlit.components.v1 as components

        # Display the styled HTML in a scrollable container
        components.html(html_content, height=800, scrolling=True)

else:
    st.info("No memo was generated for this analysis.")

Key Features of this design:

Actions First: The most important actions (Download/View) are presented to the user immediately.
Optional Preview: The long memo text is tucked away in a collapsed st.expander. This keeps the initial view clean and uncluttered. Users can choose to open it if they want a quick look without leaving the page.
Efficient: We generate the html_content only once and reuse it for both the "View in Browser" link and the on-page preview.
This layout provides a professional, user-friendly experience that respects the user's time while offering powerful flexibility.

Let me know if you have any questions about implementing this.

Thanks,
