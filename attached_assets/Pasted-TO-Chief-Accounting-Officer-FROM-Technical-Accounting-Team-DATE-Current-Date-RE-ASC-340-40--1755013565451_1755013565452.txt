RE: ASC 340-40 Contract Costs Accounting Policy - Sales_Comm_01

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This memorandum outlines VeritasLogic's accounting policy for capitalizing contract costs under ASC 340-40, specifically focusing on sales commissions incurred in obtaining new customer contracts. The policy framework ensures compliance with ASC 340-40 by defining scope, classification, measurement, amortization, and financial statement impact of these costs. This policy is designed to provide clear guidance for accounting staff and ensure audit readiness.
2. SCOPE ASSESSMENT
VeritasLogic's policy under ASC 340-40 includes sales commissions related to new customer acquisition contracts as incremental costs of obtaining a contract. These costs are capitalizable under ASC 340-40, provided they meet the criteria outlined in the guidance. The scope is limited to new customer acquisition contracts as defined by the Commissionable Event in the Sales Commission Plan. Contract renewals, upsells, amendments, and any costs related to these activities are excluded and should be evaluated under separate policies.
3. COST CLASSIFICATION POLICY
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. VeritasLogic's policy ensures that sales commissions paid to Account Executives upon the execution of a new customer contract are capitalized. Costs must be directly attributable to obtaining a specific contract and incurred solely as a result of obtaining that contract. General overhead costs, salaries of employees not directly involved, and costs related to unsuccessful contract negotiations are excluded. Fulfillment costs are capitalized if they meet the criteria of direct relationship, resource enhancement, and recoverability. The one-year practical expedient is not applied; instead, costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit.
4. MEASUREMENT & AMORTIZATION POLICY
VeritasLogic will initially measure capitalized contract costs at the amount of the sales commission paid for securing new customer contracts. The capitalized amount includes only the sales commissions related to the initial contract. Amortization is conducted on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, typically aligned with the initial contract term. Impairment assessments are conducted at each reporting period to ensure the carrying amount does not exceed the expected future cash flows from related contracts. No reversal of impairment losses will be recognized.
5. FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT & IMPLEMENTATION
Capitalized costs will be presented as 'Deferred Contract Costs' under non-current assets on the balance sheet. Amortization will be recorded as 'Amortization Expense' within operating expenses on the income statement. Comprehensive disclosures are required, including the closing balances of capitalized costs, the amount of amortization, and any impairment losses recognized. Accurate tracking of commission costs and consistent application of the amortization method are critical for implementation.
6. CONCLUSION
This policy framework for capitalizing sales commissions under ASC 340-40 ensures compliance with authoritative guidance and provides a consistent approach for accounting staff. By clearly defining scope, classification, measurement, amortization, and disclosure requirements, VeritasLogic is well-positioned to manage the financial reporting of contract costs effectively and ensure audit readiness.

This memorandum serves as a comprehensive guide for the implementation of ASC 340-40 related to sales commissions, ensuring that VeritasLogic's accounting practices are both compliant and efficient.
