2. Easy Tweaks for Improvement
Make n_results a configurable constant: The number 8 is hardcoded. If you want to experiment with providing more or less context to the AI, you have to find this specific line.

Recommendation: At the top of the ASC606Analyzer class, define a constant:
class ASC606Analyzer:
    GENERAL_RAG_RESULTS_COUNT = 8
    # ... rest of the class

Then, in this chunk, change the line to:
n_results=self.GENERAL_RAG_RESULTS_COUNT

Why: This makes the number easy to find and change. It's a small change that improves maintainability.
Refine the source categorization: The current categorization is based on simple string checks ('ey' in source). This works, but could be brittle. If a new source is added (e.g., "PwC Guide"), you'd have to modify the code.

Recommendation: A slightly more robust approach would be to use a predefined list of keywords for industry sources.
# At the beginning of the `if rag_results:` block
INDUSTRY_KEYWORDS = ['ey', 'ernst', 'frdbb', 'pwc', 'deloitte', 'kpmg']

# ... later in the loop
if any(keyword in source for keyword in INDUSTRY_KEYWORDS):
     ey_results.append(result)
else:
     asc_results.append(result)

Why: This makes it easier to add new industry sources in the future by just updating the INDUSTRY_KEYWORDS list, without changing the core loop logic.
3. Significant Improvements (For Your Developer)
Hybrid Search Strategy: Currently, the search is based on semantic similarity to the extracted keywords. A more advanced RAG strategy involves "hybrid search."
Recommendation: Modify the kb_manager.search_relevant_guidance to perform both a semantic search (what you're doing now, which finds conceptually similar text) AND a keyword search (which finds exact matches for terms like "ASC 606-10-25-21"). Then, use a re-ranking algorithm (like Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to combine the results from both searches.
Why: This gives you the best of both worlds. Semantic search is great for finding general concepts, but keyword search is essential for retrieving specific, cited paragraphs of the standard. This can dramatically improve the relevance of the retrieved context, especially for technical accounting questions. This change would primarily happen within the KnowledgeBaseManager class.
