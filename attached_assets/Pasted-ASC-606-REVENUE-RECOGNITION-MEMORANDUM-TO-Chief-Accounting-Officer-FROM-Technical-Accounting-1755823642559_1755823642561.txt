RE: Contract Analysis - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis



BACKGROUND

We have reviewed the contract documents provided by Customer to determine the appropriate revenue recognition treatment under ASC 606. This memorandum presents our analysis following the five-step ASC 606 methodology.



ASC 606 ANALYSIS

Identify the Contract

Analysis:


To determine if a valid contract exists under ASC 606-10-25-1, we must evaluate the contract between InnovateTech Solutions Inc. ("InnovateTech") and Global Dynamics Corp. ("Customer") against the criteria outlined in the guidance.


1. Approval and Commitment (ASC 606-10-25-1(a)): The Statement of Work (SOW) is entered into as of October 26, 2023, under the terms of a Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated January 15, 2022. This indicates that both parties have approved the contract in writing and are committed to performing their respective obligations. The existence of a signed SOW and reference to an MSA supports this conclusion.


2. Identification of Rights (ASC 606-10-25-1(b)): The contract clearly identifies each party's rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred. InnovateTech is obligated to provide the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license, 200 OptiScan-7 scanners, and professional services for integration and training. The Customer's rights include receiving these deliverables and providing written acceptance for the professional services.


3. Payment Terms (ASC 606-10-25-1(c)): The payment terms are explicitly outlined in the contract. The Logi-AI Suite SaaS license is priced at $240,000 per year, with the first year's fee due Net 30 from the Effective Date. The hardware and professional services have fixed fees of $50,000 and $75,000, respectively, also due Net 30. Additionally, a performance bonus of $30,000 is contingent upon achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs. These terms provide clarity on the consideration to be exchanged.


4. Commercial Substance (ASC 606-10-25-1(d)): The contract has commercial substance because it is expected to change the risk, timing, or amount of InnovateTech's future cash flows. The provision of the Logi-AI Suite and associated services will likely impact InnovateTech's revenue streams and cash flows, demonstrating commercial substance.


5. Probability of Collection (ASC 606-10-25-1(e)): It is probable that InnovateTech will collect substantially all of the consideration. The Customer is a corporation with an existing MSA, suggesting a history of business transactions and an ability to pay. The contract terms and the Customer's commitment to the project further support the likelihood of collection.


Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the contract between InnovateTech and Global Dynamics meets all the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-1 for a valid contract. The parties have approved the contract, identified their rights and payment terms, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that InnovateTech will collect the consideration.


Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.


Identify Performance Obligations

Analysis:


The contract between InnovateTech Solutions Inc. and Global Dynamics Corp. includes several promised goods and services: the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, the OptiScan-7 handheld scanners, and professional services for implementation, system integration, and training. According to ASC 606-10-25-14, each promise to transfer a good or service to the customer must be assessed to determine if it constitutes a distinct performance obligation.


1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: This is a 3-year subscription license for up to 500 users, including standard support and maintenance. Per ASC 606-10-25-19, the SaaS license is capable of being distinct because the customer can benefit from the software on its own, as it provides standalone functionality. The SaaS license is regularly sold separately, and it is not highly interdependent with other contract elements, satisfying ASC 606-10-25-21(a-c).


2. Hardware Provisioning (OptiScan-7 Scanners): The contract includes the provision of 200 proprietary scanners. These scanners are distinct because they are tangible goods that the customer can benefit from independently or with the Logi-AI Suite. The title and risk of loss transfer upon delivery, indicating they are sold separately. The scanners are not highly interdependent with the SaaS license or professional services, aligning with ASC 606-10-25-21.


3. Professional Services: These services include implementation, system integration, and training. While the Logi-AI Suite can function without these services, they enhance the platform's functionality by integrating it with the customer's ERP system. According to ASC 606-10-25-21, these services are distinct because they are separately identifiable and not highly interdependent with the SaaS license or hardware. The services are completed upon written acceptance, indicating they are a separate deliverable.


The performance bonus and bundle discount do not constitute separate performance obligations. The performance bonus is contingent on achieving specific outcomes and does not represent a distinct good or service. The bundle discount reflects a pricing adjustment rather than a separate obligation.


Conclusion:


The contract contains three distinct performance obligations: (1) the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, (2) the OptiScan-7 handheld scanners, and (3) the professional services for implementation, integration, and training. Each of these obligations is distinct per ASC 606 criteria, as they can be sold separately and are not highly interdependent.


Issues or Uncertainties:


None identified.


Determine the Transaction Price

Analysis:


In accordance with ASC 606-10-32-2, the transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The contract with Global Dynamics includes both fixed and variable consideration components.


Fixed Consideration: The fixed consideration in this contract includes the following components:

- Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: $240,000 per year for three years, totaling $720,000. This is a fixed fee due annually, with the first payment due 30 days from the effective date.

- Hardware (OptiScan-7 Scanners): A one-time fee of $50,000, due 30 days from the effective date.

- Professional Services: A one-time fee of $75,000, also due 30 days from the effective date.


Variable Consideration: The contract includes a performance bonus of $30,000, contingent upon the customer achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs within the first 12 months. According to ASC 606-10-32-5 to 32-10, variable consideration should be estimated using either the expected value or the most likely amount method. Given InnovateTech's history of achieving this metric with 80% of similar customers, the most likely amount method suggests including the $30,000 bonus in the transaction price. However, ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-14 requires that variable consideration be constrained to avoid significant revenue reversal. Given the high likelihood of achieving the performance metric, the bonus can be included in the transaction price.


Constraints on Variable Consideration: The constraint on variable consideration is minimal due to the high probability (80%) of achieving the performance metric. Therefore, the $30,000 bonus is included in the transaction price.


Significant Financing Components: Per ASC 606-10-32-15, a significant financing component exists if the timing of payments provides a significant benefit of financing. In this contract, payments are due within 30 days of the effective date or annually, which does not indicate a significant financing component as the timing does not provide a significant benefit to either party.


Noncash Consideration: There is no noncash consideration present in this contract.


Consideration Paid or Payable to a Customer: There is no consideration paid or payable to the customer identified in this contract.


Conclusion: The total transaction price for the contract with Global Dynamics is $875,000, comprising $720,000 for the SaaS license, $50,000 for hardware, $75,000 for professional services, and a $30,000 performance bonus. There are no significant financing components or noncash considerations identified.


Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.


Allocate the Transaction Price

Analysis:


In accordance with ASC 606, the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations must be based on the relative standalone selling prices (SSPs) of each distinct good or service. The contract between InnovateTech Solutions Inc. and Global Dynamics Corp. identifies three primary performance obligations: (1) the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, (2) the provision of OptiScan-7 hardware, and (3) professional services for implementation and training.


Per ASC 606-10-32-31, the SSPs should be determined separately based on observable data. This means that each performance obligation's SSP should reflect the price at which InnovateTech would sell the good or service on a standalone basis. The contract specifies that the SaaS license is priced at its standard standalone rate of $240,000 per year. However, the hardware and professional services are subject to a 10% bundle discount, indicating that their SSPs need to be adjusted to reflect this discount.


The allocation methodology, as outlined in ASC 606-10-32-29, requires that the transaction price be allocated to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. This involves calculating the proportion of the total SSPs for each obligation and applying this proportion to the total transaction price, which includes the discounted amounts for hardware and services.


According to ASC 606-10-32-37, any discount should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless it can be specifically attributed to one or more obligations. In this contract, the discount applies to both the hardware and professional services, necessitating a proportional allocation of the discount across these obligations.


The final allocation approach will depend on the determination of the SSPs for the hardware and professional services. Once these SSPs are established, the transaction price, including the discount, will be allocated proportionately based on the relative SSPs of each performance obligation.


Conclusion:


The transaction price for the contract with Global Dynamics Corp. will be allocated to the identified performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The SaaS license is priced at its standard rate, while the hardware and professional services will reflect a 10% discount. The allocation will be proportional to the SSPs, ensuring compliance with ASC 606 guidance.


Issues or Uncertainties:


None identified.


Recognize Revenue

Analysis:


The contract between InnovateTech Solutions Inc. and Global Dynamics Corp. involves multiple performance obligations, each requiring distinct revenue recognition considerations under ASC 606.


1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: The SaaS license is a subscription service provided over a 3-year period. According to ASC 606-10-25-27, revenue for services provided over time should be recognized over the period the service is delivered. The customer receives and consumes the benefits of the SaaS license simultaneously as InnovateTech performs, satisfying the criteria for over-time recognition. Therefore, the $240,000 annual fee should be recognized ratably over each year of the subscription.


2. Hardware Provisioning (OptiScan-7 Scanners): The hardware is a tangible product, and control transfers to the customer upon delivery, as specified in the contract. Per ASC 606-10-25-23, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. Thus, the $50,000 fee for the scanners should be recognized when the scanners are delivered to Global Dynamics, which is expected within 14 days of the Effective Date.


3. Professional Services: These services include implementation, system integration, and training, which are completed upon written acceptance by the customer. According to ASC 606-10-25-27, revenue for services that enhance the functionality of a product should be recognized over time as the services are performed. However, since the services are a one-time engagement and acceptance is required, revenue should be recognized at the point in time when the customer provides written acceptance. The $75,000 fee should be recognized upon completion and acceptance of the services.


4. Performance Bonus: The performance bonus is contingent upon achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs within the first 12 months. ASC 606-10-32-28 through 32-41 requires that variable consideration be included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Given InnovateTech's history of achieving this metric with 80% of similar customers, it is reasonable to include the bonus in the transaction price, but revenue should only be recognized when the reduction is achieved and documented.


Conclusion:


Revenue for the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License should be recognized over time, ratably over the subscription period. The hardware revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery. Professional services revenue is recognized at a point in time upon customer acceptance. The performance bonus is recognized when the specified cost reduction is achieved and documented.


Issues or Uncertainties:


None identified.
