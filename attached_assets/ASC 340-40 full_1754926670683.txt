20 Glossary
Contract
An agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations.
Customer
A party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange for consideration.
Not-for-Profit Entity
An entity that possesses the following characteristics, in varying degrees, that distinguish it from a business entity:
aContributions of significant amounts of resources from resource providers who do not expect commensurate or proportionate pecuniary return
bOperating purposes other than to provide goods or services at a profit
cAbsence of ownership interests like those of business entities.
Entities that clearly fall outside this definition include the following:
aAll investor-owned entities
bEntities that provide dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly and proportionately to their owners, members, or participants, such as mutual insurance entities, credit unions, farm and rural electric cooperatives, and employee benefit plans.
Performance Obligation
A promise in a contract with a customer to transfer to the customer either:
aA good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct
bA series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
Public Business Entity
A public business entity is a business entity meeting any one of the criteria below. Neither a not-for-profit entity nor an employee benefit plan is a business entity.
aIt is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file or furnish financial statements, or does file or furnish financial statements (including voluntary filers), with the SEC (including other entities whose financial statements or financial information are required to be or are included in a filing).
bIt is required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act), as amended, or rules or regulations promulgated under the Act, to file or furnish financial statements with a regulatory agency other than the SEC.
cIt is required to file or furnish financial statements with a foreign or domestic regulatory agency in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer.
dIt has issued, or is a conduit bond obligor for, securities that are traded, listed, or quoted on an exchange or an over-the-counter market.
eIt has one or more securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, and it is required by law, contract, or regulation to prepare U.S. GAAP financial statements (including notes) and make them publicly available on a periodic basis (for example, interim or annual periods). An entity must meet both of these conditions to meet this criterion.
An entity may meet the definition of a public business entity solely because its financial statements or financial information is included in another entity's filing with the SEC. In that case, the entity is only a public business entity for purposes of financial statements that are filed or furnished with the SEC.
Revenue
Inflows or other enhancements of assets of an entity or settlements of its liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing major or central operations.
Security
A share, participation, or other interest in property or in an entity of the issuer or an obligation of the issuer that has all of the following characteristics:
aIt is either represented by an instrument issued in bearer or registered form or, if not represented by an instrument, is registered in books maintained to record transfers by or on behalf of the issuer.
bIt is of a type commonly dealt in on securities exchanges or markets or, when represented by an instrument, is commonly recognized in any area in which it is issued or dealt in as a medium for investment.
cIt either is one of a class or series or by its terms is divisible into a class or series of shares, participations, interests, or obligations.
Transaction Price
The amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

25 Recognition
General
> Contract Costs
· > Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract
340-40-25-1
An entity shall recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the entity expects to recover those costs.
340-40-25-2
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, a sales commission).
340-40-25-3
Costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained shall be recognized as an expense when incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained.
340-40-25-4
As a practical expedient, an entity may recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.
· > Costs to Fulfill a Contract
340-40-25-5
An entity shall recognize an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria:
aThe costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify (for example, costs relating to services to be provided under renewal of an existing contract or costs of designing an asset to be transferred under a specific contract that has not yet been approved).
bThe costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future.
cThe costs are expected to be recovered.
340-40-25-6
For costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer that are within the scope of another Topic (for example, Topic 330 on inventory; paragraphs 340-10-25-1 through 25-4 on preproduction costs related to long-term supply arrangements; Subtopic 350-40 on internal-use software; Topic 360 on property, plant, and equipment; or Subtopic 985-20 on costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed), an entity shall account for those costs in accordance with those other Topics or Subtopics.
340-40-25-7
Costs that relate directly to a contract (or a specific anticipated contract) include any of the following:
aDirect labor (for example, salaries and wages of employees who provide the promised services directly to the customer)
bDirect materials (for example, supplies used in providing the promised services to a customer)
cAllocations of costs that relate directly to the contract or to contract activities (for example, costs of contract management and supervision, insurance, and depreciation of tools and equipment used in fulfilling the contract)
dCosts that are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract
eOther costs that are incurred only because an entity entered into the contract (for example, payments to subcontractors).
340-40-25-8
An entity shall recognize the following costs as expenses when incurred:
aGeneral and administrative costs (unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract, in which case an entity shall evaluate those costs in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-7)
bCosts of wasted materials, labor, or other resources to fulfill the contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract
cCosts that relate to satisfied performance obligations (or partially satisfied performance obligations) in the contract (that is, costs that relate to past performance)
dCosts for which an entity cannot distinguish whether the costs relate to unsatisfied performance obligations or to satisfied performance obligations (or partially satisfied performance obligations).

35 Subsequent Measurement
General
> Amortization and Impairment
340-40-35-1
An asset recognized in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1 or 340-40-25-5 shall be amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The asset may relate to goods or services to be transferred under a specific anticipated contract (as described in paragraph 340-40-25-5(a)).
340-40-35-2
An entity shall update the amortization to reflect a significant change in the entity's expected timing of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Such a change shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with Subtopic 250-10 on accounting changes and error corrections.
340-40-35-3
An entity shall recognize an impairment loss in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset recognized in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1 or 340-40-25-5 exceeds:
aThe amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive in the future and that the entity has received but has not recognized as revenue, in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates (“the consideration”), less
bThe costs that relate directly to providing those goods or services and that have not been recognized as expenses (see paragraphs 340-40-25-2 and 340-40-25-7).
340-40-35-4
For the purposes of applying paragraph 340-40-35-3 to determine the consideration, an entity shall use the principles for determining the transaction price (except for the guidance in paragraphs 606-10-32-11 through 32-13 on constraining estimates of variable consideration) and adjust that amount to reflect the effects of the customer's credit risk. When determining the consideration for the purposes of paragraph 340-40-35-3, an entity also shall consider expected contract renewals and extensions (with the same customer).
340-40-35-5
Before an entity recognizes an impairment loss for an asset recognized in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1 or 340-40-25-5, the entity shall recognize any impairment loss for assets related to the contract that are recognized in accordance with another Topic other than Topic 340 on other assets and deferred costs, Topic 350 on goodwill and other intangible assets, or Topic 360 on property, plant, and equipment (for example, Topic 330 on inventory and Subtopic 985-20 on costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed). After applying the impairment test in paragraph 340-40-35-3, an entity shall include the resulting carrying amount of the asset recognized in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1 or 340-40-25-5 in the carrying amount of the asset group or reporting unit to which it belongs for the purpose of applying the guidance in Topics 360 and 350.
340-40-35-6
An entity shall not recognize a reversal of an impairment loss previously recognized.

55 Implementation Guidance and Illustrations
General
> Illustrations
· > Contract Costs
340-40-55-1
Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the guidance in paragraphs 340-40-25-1 through 25-4 on incremental costs of obtaining a contract, paragraphs 340-40-25-5 through 25-8 on costs to fulfill a contract, and paragraphs 340-40-35-1 through 35-6 on amortization and impairment of contract costs.
· · > Example 1—Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract
340-40-55-2
An entity, a provider of consulting services, wins a competitive bid to provide consulting services to a new customer. The entity incurred the following costs to obtain the contract:
External legal fees for due diligence $15,000
Travel costs to deliver proposal 25,000
Commissions to sales employees 10,000
Total costs incurred $50,000
          
340-40-55-3
In accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1, the entity recognizes an asset for the $10,000 incremental costs of obtaining the contract arising from the commissions to sales employees because the entity expects to recover those costs through future fees for the consulting services. The entity also pays discretionary annual bonuses to sales supervisors based on annual sales targets, overall profitability of the entity, and individual performance evaluations. In accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1, the entity does not recognize an asset for the bonuses paid to sales supervisors because the bonuses are not incremental to obtaining a contract. The amounts are discretionary and are based on other factors, including the profitability of the entity and the individuals' performance. The bonuses are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts.
340-40-55-4
The entity observes that the external legal fees and travel costs would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-3, those costs are recognized as expenses when incurred, unless they are within the scope of another Topic, in which case, the guidance in that Topic applies.
· · > Example 2—Costs That Give Rise to an Asset
340-40-55-5
An entity enters into a service contract to manage a customer's information technology data center for five years. The contract is renewable for subsequent one-year periods. The average customer term is seven years. The entity pays an employee a $10,000 sales commission upon the customer signing the contract. Before providing the services, the entity designs and builds a technology platform for the entity's internal use that interfaces with the customer's systems. That platform is not transferred to the customer but will be used to deliver services to the customer.
· · · > Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract
340-40-55-6
In accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1, the entity recognizes an asset for the $10,000 incremental costs of obtaining the contract for the sales commission because the entity expects to recover those costs through future fees for the services to be provided. The entity amortizes the asset over seven years in accordance with paragraph 340-40-35-1 because the asset relates to the services transferred to the customer during the contract term of five years and the entity anticipates that the contract will be renewed for two subsequent one-year periods.
· · · > Costs to Fulfill a Contract
340-40-55-7
The initial costs incurred to set up the technology platform are as follows:
Design services $40,000
Hardware 120,000
Software 90,000
Migration and testing of data center 100,000
Total costs $350,000

340-40-55-8
The initial setup costs relate primarily to activities to fulfill the contract but do not transfer goods or services to the customer. The entity accounts for the initial setup costs as follows:
aHardware costs—accounted for in accordance with Topic 360 on property, plant, and equipment
bSoftware costs—accounted for in accordance with Subtopic 350-40 on internal-use software
cCosts of the design, migration, and testing of the data center—assessed in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-5 to determine whether an asset can be recognized for the costs to fulfill the contract. Any resulting asset would be amortized on a systematic basis over the seven-year period (that is, the five-year contract term and two anticipated one-year renewal periods) that the entity expects to provide services related to the data center.
340-40-55-9
In addition to the initial costs to set up the technology platform, the entity also assigns two employees who are primarily responsible for providing the service to the customer. Although the costs for these two employees are incurred as part of providing the service to the customer, the entity concludes that the costs do not generate or enhance resources of the entity (see paragraph 340-40-25-5(b)). Therefore, the costs do not meet the criteria in paragraph 340-40-25-5 and cannot be recognized as an asset using this Topic. In accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-8, the entity recognizes the payroll expense for these two employees when incurred.
