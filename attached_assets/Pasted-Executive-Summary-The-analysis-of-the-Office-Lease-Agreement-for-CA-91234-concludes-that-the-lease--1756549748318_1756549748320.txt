Executive Summary
The analysis of the Office Lease Agreement for CA 91234 concludes that the lease arrangement qualifies as an operating lease under ASC 842. The lease provides the Tenant with the right to control the use of an identified asset, specifically the office space, for a fixed term of five years, commencing November 1, 2023, and concluding October 31, 2028. The agreement does not include substantive termination options, thereby solidifying the enforceable period.

Key determinations from the analysis indicate that the total fixed lease payments amount to $189,375 over the lease term, with a present value of approximately $171,000 calculated using a 7% discount rate. The lease does not meet the criteria for finance lease classification, and as such, will be recognized as an operating lease. Initial journal entries will reflect the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability at this present value. It is important to note that the lease expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis, and any modifications or remeasurement will require careful evaluation to ensure compliance with ASC 842 disclosure requirements.

Significant judgments made during this analysis include the exclusion of nonlease components from the lease liability calculation and the decision not to apply any practical expedients due to the straightforward nature of the lease payments. Proper presentation and disclosure of lease-related information will be essential for financial reporting, ensuring transparency and adherence to ASC 842 standards.

Background
This memorandum serves to provide a preliminary analysis of the lease arrangement for CA 91234 as of August 2025, in accordance with the ASC 842 lease accounting standard. The lease arrangement under review involves the leasing of office space, which is critical for the entity's operational activities. The analysis will apply the ASC 842 methodology, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12 months, reflecting the present value of lease payments. It is important to note that this is a document-only preliminary analysis, and reasonable assumptions have been made to address any missing data in order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the lease's impact on CA 91234's financial statements.
