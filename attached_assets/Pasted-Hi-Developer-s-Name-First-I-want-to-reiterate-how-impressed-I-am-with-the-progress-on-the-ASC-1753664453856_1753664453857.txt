Hi [Developer's Name],

First, I want to reiterate how impressed I am with the progress on the ASC 606 analyzer. The shift to the step-by-step analysis architecture has been a massive success, and the quality of the individual step analyses is exactly what we need.

I’ve been running further tests and analysis, and I’ve run into the "incomplete memo" issue we discussed. My investigation, combined with advice from my AI consultant, has pinpointed the root cause. The issue isn't a simple bug, but a fundamental limitation in how LLM APIs operate, and it requires a final architectural enhancement to solve permanently.

This email outlines the "why" and provides a detailed plan for the "how." This is the final evolution of our system, moving from a simple assembly prompt to a robust "Synthesis & Assembly Loop" driven by our Python code.

The Core Problem: Why the Memo is Incomplete
The current get_final_memo_generation_prompt is hitting two walls:

Hard API Limit: The OpenAI API silently truncates responses at 4,096 output tokens, regardless of what max_tokens we request. Our detailed memo is simply too large for a single API response.
Architectural Unreliability: Asking a single LLM call to re-read and re-write 10,000+ tokens of detailed analysis is an inefficient and unreliable task. The model is prone to "losing focus" or stopping early.
The solution is to stop using the LLM as a "document assembler" and instead use it as a "prose generator" for specific sections, while Python handles the final assembly.

The New Architecture: Python-Driven "Synthesis & Assembly"
The 5-step analysis loop you built is perfect and will remain the core of our "Analysis Engine." We are now going to refactor the final memo generation step to be a "Presentation Engine" controlled by asc606_analyzer.py.

Here is the detailed, proposed workflow:

New Workflow in asc606_analyzer.py:

# In asc606_analyzer.py

# ... (The 5-step analysis loop generating the `step_results` dictionary remains IDENTICAL) ...
# ... (The `if failed_steps:` check also remains IDENTICAL) ...

# === NEW: STEP 3 - PYTHON-DRIVEN SYNTHESIS & ASSEMBLY ===
self.logger.info("Assembling final memo via Synthesis & Assembly Loop...")

# Get the detailed analysis data for easy access
s1, s2, s3, s4, s5 = [step_results.get(f"step_{i}", {}) for i in range(1, 6)]

# --- A) SYNTHESIS: Use small, focused LLM calls to write prose-heavy sections ---

# 1. Generate the Executive Summary
# This prompt asks the AI to act as a partner and synthesize the key findings.
summary_prompt = StepAnalysisPrompts.get_summary_generation_prompt(
    step1_conclusion=s1.get('executive_conclusion'),
    step2_conclusion=s2.get('executive_conclusion'),
    # ... and so on for all 5 steps
)
executive_summary = make_llm_call(self.client, summary_prompt, model='gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=1000)

# 2. Generate the Key Judgments Section
# This prompt asks the AI to synthesize the most critical judgments from across all steps.
judgments_prompt = StepAnalysisPrompts.get_key_judgments_generation_prompt(
    step1_judgments=s1.get('professional_judgments'),
    step2_judgments=s2.get('professional_judgments'),
    # ... and so on for all 5 steps
)
key_judgments = make_llm_call(self.client, judgments_prompt, model='gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=1000)

# (We can repeat this pattern for other synthesized sections like "Conclusion")


# --- B) ASSEMBLY: Use Python code to format the large, detailed sections (NO LLM) ---

# 3. Assemble the "Detailed Analysis" Section
# This is a fast, reliable string formatting loop in Python.
detailed_analysis_sections = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    step_data = step_results.get(f"step_{i}", {})
    # This new helper function will deterministically format the JSON into markdown
    formatted_step_prose = StepAnalysisPrompts.format_step_detail_as_markdown(step_data)
    detailed_analysis_sections.append(formatted_step_prose)
detailed_analysis_body = "\n\n---\n\n".join(detailed_analysis_sections)


# --- C) FINAL COMPOSITION: Stitch all the generated and formatted parts together in Python ---

final_memo_parts = [
    f"## Executive Summary\n{executive_summary}",
    # We can add a simple, formatted Background section here too
    f"## Background\nThis memo analyzes the contract between {contract_data.customer_name}...",
    f"## Detailed Analysis\n{detailed_analysis_body}",
    f"## Key Judgments\n{key_judgments}",
    # ... etc for Financial Impact and Conclusion
]
final_memo = "\n\n".join(final_memo_parts)

self.logger.info(f"Final memo fully assembled: {len(final_memo)} characters")

# The rest of the `asc606_analyzer.py` file (returning the ASC606Analysis object) remains the same.
# It will now contain a guaranteed-complete `professional_memo`.

New/Updated Prompts Needed in step_prompts.py
This new architecture requires us to replace the single, monolithic get_final_memo_generation_prompt with a few smaller, specialist prompts and one Python helper function.

1. New Python Helper Function: format_step_detail_as_markdown This function's job is to take the rich JSON for one step and convert it into a well-formatted Markdown string. This is deterministic and requires no AI.

2. New LLM Prompts for Synthesis:

get_summary_generation_prompt: Takes the five executive_conclusion strings and asks the AI to write a cohesive summary.
get_key_judgments_generation_prompt: Takes the five professional_judgments strings and asks the AI to synthesize them into a consolidated list of the most critical judgments.
(And similar prompts for any other "big picture" sections).
I can provide drafts for these new prompts if helpful.

Why This is the Right Final Step
This "Synthesis & Assembly Loop" is the gold standard for this kind of task.

It Solves the Truncation Problem: The final memo size is no longer limited by the AI's output cap.
It's More Reliable: It breaks a single, giant, unreliable task into multiple small, highly reliable tasks.
It's More Efficient: It uses the powerful gpt-4o for the heavy analysis and the cheaper, faster gpt-4o-mini for the simpler synthesis tasks.
It Empowers the "Senior Manager": This architecture properly assigns the "synthesis" and "big picture" responsibility to specific AI calls, addressing the concern about missing the forest for the trees.
Please review this proposed architecture. I am convinced this is the final key to unlocking the reliable, comprehensive, and audit-quality memo generation we've been working towards. I'm ready to discuss and help in any way I can.

Thank you for your excellent partnership in building this.

Best regards,
