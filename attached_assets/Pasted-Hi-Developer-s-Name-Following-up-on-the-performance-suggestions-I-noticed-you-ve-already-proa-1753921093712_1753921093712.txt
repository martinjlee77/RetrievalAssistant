Hi [Developer's Name],

Following up on the performance suggestions, I noticed you've already proactively created an async version of our LLM call function (make_llm_call_async) in llm.py. This is excellent and gets us more than halfway to a huge performance win!

The goal now is to wire this up in the ASC606Analyzer to run the five step-by-step analysis calls concurrently. This should dramatically reduce the user's total wait time.

Hereâ€™s a proposed plan to refactor the analysis loop:

Step 1: Modify analyze_contract to be Asynchronous

In asc606_analyzer.py, change the main method signature from def to async def:
# From:
def analyze_contract(self, ...) -> ASC606Analysis:

# To:
async def analyze_contract(self, ...) -> ASC606Analysis:

Step 2: Refactor the Step-Analysis Loop

Inside analyze_contract, we'll change the loop to prepare all five analysis calls first, and then run them all at once.
We'll need to import make_llm_call_async and asyncio.
# --- Current Synchronous Loop ---
# for step_num in range(1, 6):
#     # ... prepares prompt
#     step_response = make_llm_call(...)
#     # ... processes response


# --- Proposed Asynchronous Refactor ---
# Import make_llm_call_async at the top of the file
# from utils.llm import make_llm_call_async

# ... inside async def analyze_contract ...

tasks = []
prompt_details = {} # To hold details for processing later

# 1. Prepare all tasks
for step_num in range(1, 6):
    step_info = step_mapping[step_num]
    # ... code to prepare step_specific_context and step_prompt ...

    # Store details needed to process the response
    prompt_details[step_num] = {
        "step_info": step_info
    }

    # Create an async task for the LLM call, but don't run it yet
    task = asyncio.create_task(make_llm_call_async(
        self.client,
        step_prompt,
        # ... other params: temperature, max_tokens, etc. ...
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    ))
    tasks.append(task)

# 2. Run all tasks concurrently
self.logger.info(f"Executing {len(tasks)} step-analysis tasks concurrently...")
step_responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
self.logger.info("All step-analysis tasks completed.")

# 3. Process the results
for i, response in enumerate(step_responses):
    step_num = i + 1
    step_info = prompt_details[step_num]["step_info"]

    if isinstance(response, Exception):
        # Handle exceptions from asyncio.gather
        self.logger.error(f"Step {step_num} failed with exception: {response}")
        failed_steps.append((step_num, step_info['title'], str(response)))
        step_results[f"step_{step_num}"] = {"error": str(response)}
    else:
        # Process the successful response
        step_analysis_raw = json.loads(response) if response else {}
        step_analysis_sanitized = self._sanitize_llm_json(step_analysis_raw)
        step_results[f"step_{step_num}"] = step_analysis_sanitized
        self.logger.info(f"Step {step_num} result processed successfully.")

Step 3: Modify the Top-Level Call in the Streamlit Page

Since Streamlit runs in a synchronous environment, we'll need to use asyncio.run() to execute our new async method from the main Streamlit script (e.g., app.py or wherever the "Generate Memo" button is).
# In the "Generate Memo" button logic:
# Instead of:
# analysis_results = analyzer.analyze_contract(...)

# We would use:
analysis_results = asyncio.run(analyzer.analyze_contract(...))

This refactoring is a significant change, but it directly targets the biggest performance bottleneck in the application and should make the analysis feel much faster for the user.

Let me know your thoughts on the feasibility of this approach.

Thanks,
