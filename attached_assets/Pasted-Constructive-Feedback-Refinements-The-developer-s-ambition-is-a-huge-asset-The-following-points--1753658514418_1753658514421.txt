Constructive Feedback & Refinements
The developer's ambition is a huge asset. The following points are not criticisms but refinements to make his excellent work more robust and reliable in a production environment.

1. The Heuristic Parsing is Clever but Brittle (High Priority)
Observation: In _parse_and_format_memo_content, the code uses heuristics to identify special content, for example: if 'contract states' in line.lower(): to detect a quote, or if 'asc 606' in line.lower(): to detect a citation.
The Risk: This is very clever, but it's brittle. It relies on the LLM using those exact phrases. If the LLM generates "The agreement stipulates..." or "As noted in ASC-606...", the special formatting will fail.
The Solution (Revisiting Our Previous Suggestion): This is the perfect use case for semantic markers. We should update the main LLM prompt to instruct it to wrap specific content in simple tags.
Example for the prompt: "When providing a direct quote from the contract, wrap it in [QUOTE]...[/QUOTE] tags. When referencing the accounting standard, wrap it in [CITATION]...[/CITATION] tags."
The Python parser can then be simplified and made 100% reliable:
# In _parse_and_format_memo_content
if line.startswith('[QUOTE]'):
    # Apply quote formatting to line.strip('[QUOTE]')
elif line.startswith('[CITATION]'):
    # Apply citation formatting to line.strip('[CITATION]')

Recommendation: This is the single most important refinement. It makes the system robust by creating a clear contract between the LLM and the formatting code.
2. The Table of Contents (TOC) Implementation is Flawed (Medium Priority)
Observation: The developer attempted to add a Table of Contents, which is a very advanced feature. The code collects toc_entries and then tries to add them to the document at the end of the parsing function.
The Technical Issue: In python-docx, document.add_paragraph() always appends to the end of the document. The current implementation will place the TOC at the very bottom of the memo, right before the metadata page, not at the top after the header. Inserting content at the beginning of a document is non-trivial and requires complex XML manipulation.
Recommendation:
(Option A - Recommended): Acknowledge the great attempt, but agree to defer the TOC feature as planned for Phase 3. It's better to have no TOC than one that appears in the wrong place. Remove the TOC-related code for now to keep the output clean.
(Option B - Advanced): If a TOC is a must-have now, it requires a different approach, such as creating a temporary document with the TOC and then merging it with the main document, which is complex. It's best to stick to the phased plan.
