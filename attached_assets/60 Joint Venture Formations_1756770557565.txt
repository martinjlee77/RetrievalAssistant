05 Overview and Background
General
805-60-05-1
This Subtopic provides guidance on the accounting and reporting for the formation of a joint venture or a corporate joint venture (collectively, joint ventures) in a joint venture’s separate financial statements.
805-60-05-2
Paragraph 805-60-25-2 requires that a joint venture account for its formation by applying a new basis of accounting. In accounting for the formation of a joint venture, none of the assets and/or businesses contributed to the joint venture are viewed as having survived the combination as independent entities. Rather, the formation is viewed as the transfer of the net assets to a new entity that assumes control over them. The history of that new reporting entity begins with the joint venture formation. A joint venture establishes a new basis of accounting upon formation by applying aspects of the acquisition method for business combinations, with adaptations that are unique to joint ventures as described in this Subtopic. Accounting for a joint venture formation includes the following steps:
aDetermining the formation date
bRecognizing and measuring the identifiable assets, the liabilities, and any noncontrolling interest in the net assets recognized by the joint venture
cRecognizing and measuring goodwill, if any, using the fair value of the joint venture as a whole immediately following formation.

25 Recognition
General
805-60-25-1
An entity shall determine whether a transaction or an event is a joint venture formation by applying the definition of joint venture (or corporate joint venture) and the guidance in paragraph 805-60-25-3 on its formation date. If the transaction or event is not a joint venture formation, the reporting entity shall account for the transaction or event in accordance with other generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
805-60-25-2
Accounting for joint venture formations as described in this Subtopic requires that a joint venture establish upon formation a new basis of accounting for its assets and liabilities in accordance with Subtopic 805-20 on identifiable assets and liabilities, and any noncontrolling interest. A joint venture shall recognize goodwill, if any, in accordance with paragraph 805-60-25-13. Unlike the acquisition method, accounting for the formation of a joint venture does not include the identification of an acquirer. This Section includes the following requirements:
aDetermining the formation date
bDetermining whether multiple arrangements should be accounted for as a single formation transaction
cDetermining what is part of the joint venture formation
dAccounting for the formation of a joint venture, as applicable:
1New basis of accounting
2Private company accounting alternatives

5Transfers of financial assets.
> Determining the Formation Date
805-60-25-3
The joint venture formation date is the date on which an entity initially meets the definition of a joint venture, which is not necessarily the legal entity formation date. A joint venture’s formation date is the measurement date for the formation transaction. A joint venture shall determine a single formation date and account for its formation as of that date. A joint venture shall consider the pertinent facts and circumstances in identifying its formation date. All contributions received, or that are receivable, as of the formation date, including consideration of the guidance in paragraphs 805-60-25-4 through 25-5 on multiple arrangements that should be accounted for as a single formation transaction, constitute the joint venture formation transaction.
> Determining Whether Multiple Arrangements Should Be Accounted for as a Single Formation Transaction
805-60-25-4
Multiple arrangements may establish the formation of a joint venture and constitute the joint venture formation transaction. Circumstances sometimes indicate that the multiple arrangements should be accounted for as a single transaction. In determining whether to account for the multiple arrangements as a single transaction that establishes the formation, a joint venture shall consider the terms and conditions of the arrangements and their economic effects. Any of the following may indicate that the joint venture should account for the multiple arrangements as a single transaction that established the formation of the joint venture:
aThe multiple arrangements are entered into at the same time or in contemplation of one another.
bThe multiple arrangements form a single transaction designed to achieve an overall commercial effect.
cThe occurrence of one arrangement is dependent on the occurrence of at least one other arrangement.
dOne arrangement considered on its own is not economically justified, but the multiple arrangements are economically justified when considered together.
805-60-25-5
If multiple arrangements are accounted for as a single transaction in accordance with paragraph 805-60-25-4, then the formation date shall be the measurement date for all arrangements that form part of the single formation transaction. A joint venture shall recognize identifiable assets and liabilities that are part of that single transaction when they satisfy the recognition criteria described in paragraph 805-60-25-2.
> Determining What Is Part of the Joint Venture Formation
805-60-25-6
A joint venture and its owners (the venturers) may enter into an arrangement upon formation that is separate from the formation of the joint venture. For example, a joint venture may enter into an arrangement with a venturer to compensate the venturer or others (such as employees of the venturers) for future services. A joint venture shall apply the guidance in paragraphs 805-10-55-24 through 55-26 when determining whether a transaction involving payments to be made by the joint venture to the venturers or others is separate from or part of a joint venture formation. A joint venture shall identify any amounts that are separate from the formation of the joint venture and shall recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities that are determined to be part of the joint venture formation. Separate transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with other relevant GAAP.
805-60-25-7
A joint venture shall not apply by analogy the guidance in paragraphs 805-10-55-20 through 55-23 (for a transaction that in effect settles preexisting relationships between the acquirer and the acquiree) or paragraph 805-10-25-23 (for acquisition-related costs and transactions that reimburse the acquiree or its former owners for paying the acquirer’s acquisition-related costs).
805-60-25-8
If, upon formation, a joint venture issues share-based payment awards to replace awards held by grantees of the contributed entities, then the joint venture shall apply the guidance in paragraphs 805-30-30-9 through 30-13 to allocate the fair-value-based measure of replacement share-based payment awards between preformation vesting and postformation compensation cost. Paragraphs 805-60-55-2 through 55-14 provide illustrations of the accounting for the issuance of replacement share-based payment awards in a joint venture formation.
805-60-25-9
For the purposes of applying the business combinations guidance on arrangements that include contingent payments to employees or selling shareholders and replacement share-based payment awards referenced in paragraphs 805-60-25-6 through 25-8:
aThe joint venture shall be viewed as analogous to the acquirer in a business combination.
bThe venturers shall be viewed as analogous to the selling shareholders.
cThe recognized businesses and/or assets shall be viewed as analogous to an acquiree.
> Accounting for the Formation of a Joint Venture
· > New Basis of Accounting
805-60-25-10
At the formation date, a joint venture shall account for its formation by establishing a new basis of accounting for its identifiable assets and liabilities, and any noncontrolling interest, in accordance with Subtopic 805-20.
805-60-25-11
A joint venture shall account for its formation in accordance with this Subtopic regardless of whether the assets or group of assets recognized by the joint venture constitute a business in accordance with Subtopic 805-10.
· > Private Company Accounting Alternatives
805-60-25-12
A joint venture that is a private company may elect to apply the accounting alternative for the recognition of identifiable intangible assets described in paragraphs 805-20-25-30 through 25-33. In accordance with paragraph 805-20-15-4, a joint venture that elects to apply this accounting alternative must adopt the accounting alternative for amortizing goodwill in the Accounting Alternatives Subsections of Subtopic 350-20.
· > Goodwill
805-60-25-13
In accounting for its formation, a joint venture shall recognize goodwill as of the formation date, when applicable. The presence of more than an insignificant amount of goodwill is expected to be unusual if, at formation, the assets or group of assets recognized by the joint venture do not constitute a business in accordance with Subtopic 805-10. Paragraph 805-60-30-2 describes how a joint venture should measure goodwill upon its formation.
· > Measurement Period
805-60-25-14
If the initial accounting for a joint venture formation is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the formation date occurs, the joint venture may apply the measurement period guidance in paragraphs 805-10-25-13 through 25-19 for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Joint ventures that apply the measurement period guidance shall disclose the information described in paragraph 805-60-50-3.
· > Transfers of Financial Assets
805-60-25-15
If a venturer transfers financial assets that are within the scope of Subtopic 860-10 to the joint venture upon formation, then the joint venture shall determine whether the transfer results in the recognition of the transferred financial assets by the joint venture by applying the guidance in Subtopic 860-10.

30 Initial Measurement
General
> Identifiable Assets and Liabilities, and Any Noncontrolling Interest
805-60-30-1
A joint venture shall measure its identifiable assets and liabilities, and any noncontrolling interest, recognized at the formation date in accordance with Subtopic 805-20.
> Goodwill
805-60-30-2
A joint venture shall apply the guidance in this paragraph to measure goodwill, when applicable. A joint venture shall recognize goodwill, if any, upon formation, measured as the excess of (a) over (b):
aThe formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole. The formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole shall equal the fair value of 100 percent of the joint venture’s equity (net assets) immediately following formation (including any noncontrolling interest in the net assets recognized by the joint venture).
bThe net of the formation-date amounts of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognized by the joint venture and measured in accordance with Subtopic 805-20.
805-60-30-3
Upon formation, a joint venture shall recognize the amount of its identifiable net assets recognized in excess of the fair value of the joint venture as a whole, if any, as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital (or other similar equity account, such as members’ equity).
> Instruments, Contracts, and Share-Based Payment Awards Classified as Equity
805-60-30-4
The amount of any separately recognized equity-classified instruments or contracts issued by a joint venture as part of the formation transaction, other than equity-classified replacement share-based payment awards (see paragraph 805-60-30-5), shall be accounted for as a reallocation of additional paid-in capital (or other similar equity account, such as members’ equity) and shall not affect the total amount of equity or goodwill recognized by the joint venture upon formation.
805-60-30-5
A joint venture shall initially measure equity-classified replacement share-based payment awards at the fair-value-based measurement method described in Topic 718 on stock compensation. The fair-value-based amount allocated to preformation vesting (in accordance with paragraph 805-60-25-8) of any replacement share-based payments classified as equity shall be recognized as a reallocation of additional paid-in capital (or other similar equity account, such as members’ equity) and shall not affect the total amount of equity or goodwill recognized by the joint venture upon formation.
> Liability-Classified and Asset-Classified Contingent Payments and Replacement Share-Based Payment Awards
805-60-30-6
A joint venture shall initially measure any contingent payment arrangements between the joint venture and its venturers that are classified as liabilities (or assets), other than replacement share-based payment awards, in accordance with paragraph 805-60-30-1. A joint venture shall not account for those arrangements generated as a result of the joint venture formation as contingent consideration or as an assumed contingent consideration arrangement.
805-60-30-7
A joint venture shall initially measure liability-classified replacement share-based payment awards using the fair-value-based measurement method described in Topic 718 on stock compensation (consistent with the requirements in paragraphs 805-60-25-8 and 805-60-30-1).

35 Subsequent Measurement
General
805-60-35-1
A joint venture shall subsequently measure and account for the assets and liabilities recognized upon formation in accordance with the requirements for acquirers of a business in Sections 805-10-35, 805-20-35, and 805-30-35, and other generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as applicable.
805-60-35-2
A joint venture that is a private company may elect to apply the accounting alternatives for the subsequent measurement of goodwill described in paragraphs 350-20-35-62 through 35-82.

45 Other Presentation Matters
General
> Disclosure of Formation Date Balance Sheet
805-60-45-1
To satisfy the requirements in paragraph 805-60-50-2(e), a joint venture may, in lieu of disclosure in the notes to financial statements, present a statement of financial position as of the formation date that reflects the amounts recognized by the joint venture for each major class of assets and liabilities as a result of its formation.

50 Disclosure
General
805-60-50-1
A joint venture shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to understand the nature and financial effect of the joint venture formation in the period in which the formation date occurs.
805-60-50-2
In the period of formation, a joint venture shall disclose the following:
aThe formation date
bA description of the purpose for which the joint venture was formed (for example, to share risks and rewards in developing a new market, product, or technology; to combine complementary technological knowledge; or to pool resources in developing production or other facilities)
cThe formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole
dA description of the assets and liabilities recognized by the joint venture at the formation date
eThe amounts recognized by the joint venture for each major class of assets and liabilities as a result of accounting for its formation, either presented on the face of financial statements or disclosed in the notes to financial statements (see paragraph 805-60-45-1)
fA qualitative description of the factors that make up any goodwill recognized, such as expected synergies from combining operations of the contributed assets or businesses, intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, or other factors.
805-60-50-3
If the initial accounting for a joint venture formation is incomplete (see paragraph 805-60-25-14) for particular assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, or the formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole and the amounts recognized in the financial statements for the joint venture formation thus have been determined only provisionally, the joint venture shall disclose the following information:
aThe reasons why the initial accounting is incomplete
bThe assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, or the formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole for which the initial accounting is incomplete
cThe nature and amount of any measurement period adjustments recognized during the reporting period, including separately the amount of adjustment to current-period income statement line items relating to the income effects that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustment to provisional amounts was recognized as of the formation date.

55 Implementation Guidance and Illustrations
General
805-60-55-1
This Section is an integral part of the requirements of this Subtopic. This Section provides illustrations that address the general application of accounting requirements for joint venture formations.
> Illustrations
· > Example 1: Joint Venture Replacement Share-Based Payment Employee Awards
805-60-55-2
On January 1, 20X0, a newly formed corporation with no assets or liabilities, New Venture, receives contributions of a controlling financial interest in Business A (90 percent voting interest) from Venturer 1 and Business B (100 percent voting interest) from Venturer 2 and, in exchange, issues 50 common shares to each Venturer 1 and Venturer 2. Assume that New Venture has no other classes of equity or any other equity instruments outstanding before receiving the contributions. It is determined that New Venture first met the definition of a joint venture on January 1, 20X0. New Venture determines January 1, 20X0, to be its formation date.
805-60-55-3
In accordance with paragraph 805-60-30-2, but before consideration of any liabilities for share-based payments, New Venture determines that the fair value of the joint venture as a whole is $100 million including a noncontrolling interest (10 percent voting interest) in Business A that is owned by an outside entity. It also determines, in accordance with paragraph 805-60-30-2, that the formation-date fair value of the identifiable assets is $120 million, the fair value of the liabilities is $40 million, and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in Business A is $5 million.
805-60-55-4
Upon formation, New Venture exchanges replacement awards that require one year of postformation vesting for share-based payment awards of Business A for which employees had not yet rendered all of the required services as of the formation date. The fair-value-based measure of both awards (the original awards and the replacement awards) is $20 million at the formation date. When originally granted, the awards of the contributed business had a requisite service period of four years. As of the formation date, the contributed business’s employees had rendered two years’ service, and they would have been required to render two additional years of service after the formation date for their awards to vest. Accordingly, only a portion of the contributed business’s awards is attributable to preformation vesting.
805-60-55-5
The replacement awards require only one year of postformation vesting. Because employees have already rendered two years of service, the total requisite service period is three years. For simplicity, assume that New Venture estimates that there will be no forfeitures of the replacement share-based payment awards. The portion attributable to preformation vesting equals the fair-value-based measure of the contributed business’s award ($20 million) multiplied by the ratio of the preformation vesting period (2 years) to the greater of the total service period (3 years) and the original service period of the contributed business’s award (4 years). Thus, $10 million ($20 million × 2 ÷ 4 years) is attributable to preformation vesting and, therefore, New Venture’s additional paid-in capital upon formation. The remaining $10 million is attributable to postformation vesting and therefore recognized as compensation cost in New Venture’s postformation financial statements in accordance with Topic 718 on stock compensation.
805-60-55-6
New Venture applies the guidance in Topic 718 to determine whether the share-based payments should be classified as liabilities or equity.
· · > Case A: Joint Venture Replacement Share-Based Payment Employee Awards Are Liability Classified
805-60-55-7
If New Venture determines that the replacement share-based payment awards are classified as liabilities, then total liabilities will equal $50 million ($40 million + $10 million). For simplicity, when taking the share-based payment liabilities into account, the fair value of New Venture as a whole is $90 million ($100 million – $10 million).
805-60-55-8
New Venture calculates goodwill as follows (in millions), consistent with the guidance in paragraph 805-60-30-2. The formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole is equal to the fair value of 100 percent of the joint venture’s equity (net assets) immediately following formation (including any noncontrolling interest in the net assets recognized by the joint venture).

805-60-55-11
If New Venture determines that the replacement share-based payment awards are classified as equity, then total liabilities will equal $40 million and the fair value of New Venture as a whole is $100 million.
805-60-55-12
New Venture calculates goodwill as follows (in millions), consistent with the guidance in paragraph 805-60-30-2. The formation-date fair value of the joint venture as a whole is equal to the fair value of 100 percent of the joint venture’s equity (net assets) immediately following formation (including any noncontrolling interest in the net assets recognized by the joint venture).
