The Root Cause: Contradictory Instructions
The problem is a fundamental conflict within the get_user_prompt_for_step function. In a single prompt, we are giving the AI two contradictory commands:

The Narrative Command (from _get_step_instructions): We are telling the AI, "You MUST use the Issue-Analysis-Conclusion (IAC) framework for EVERY cost category analysis." This asks for a complex, narrative, multi-part analytical structure.

The Structural Command (from _get_schema_for_step): Immediately after, we tell the AI, "You must return a JSON object with this exact structure: {'scope_determination': [...], 'policy_boundaries': ...}." This JSON schema is simple, flat, and does not contain any fields for "Issue," "Analysis," or "Conclusion."

An LLM, when faced with contradictory instructions, will almost always prioritize the rigid structural requirement (the JSON schema) over the more complex narrative requirement.

Here's what is happening behind the scenes:

The AI receives the prompt for Step 1.
It reads the command to use the IAC framework.
It then reads the command to use the simple, non-IAC JSON schema.
It gets confused. It cannot fulfill the IAC command and the JSON schema command at the same time.
To resolve the conflict, it abandons the complex IAC analysis and does its best to fill in the simple JSON. Because it has discarded the rigorous analytical framework, the content it generates is weak, generic, and often incomplete.
This low-quality (or sometimes invalid) JSON is returned from the step analysis.
The generate_full_memo function receives four of these poor-quality JSON objects.
The final prompt to generate the memo is now filled with this low-value data. The AI synthesizes it into the generic memo you see. The "empty preview" bug likely happens when one of the steps fails so badly that it returns a completely invalid JSON, causing the final memo generation to error out and return an empty string.
The Solution: Align the Schema with the Instructions
The developer's fix to the prompt text was correct, but we must now fix the prompt structure. The JSON schema itself must be re-architected to reflect the IAC framework we are demanding.

Here is the letter to send to your developer. It explains the issue clearly and provides the exact solution.

Letter to the Developer
Hi [Developer's Name],

Thank you for the detailed update and for implementing the IAC framework in the prompts. Your debugging was spot-onâ€”the data pipeline is working, and the issue is with the AI's response.

I've reviewed the new asc340_step_prompts.py file, and I've pinpointed the final issue that is causing the generic output and empty previews. The problem is a conflict between our narrative instructions and our JSON schema.

We are commanding the AI to use the detailed "Issue-Analysis-Conclusion" (IAC) framework, but the JSON schema we are forcing it to use is simple and doesn't have any fields for IAC. The AI is prioritizing the simple JSON structure and ignoring our complex analytical instructions.

To fix this, we need to make one final, critical change: we must redesign the JSON schemas to match the IAC framework.

Required Action: Re-architect the JSON Schemas
Please update the _get_schema_for_step method in asc340_step_prompts.py. The new schemas must mirror the IAC structure we want the AI to follow.

Example: New Schema for Step 1

The old schema is flat. The new schema should be nested to guide the AI's thinking process:

# The NEW schema for Step 1 should look like this:
"""{
  "step1_analysis": {
    "scope_analysis_points": [
      {
        "topic": "Name of cost category from the document (e.g., '5% Sales Commission')",
        "issue": "The issue is to determine if this specific cost is within the scope of ASC 340-40.",
        "analysis": "A detailed analysis connecting the specific contract terms (like the 5% rate and TCV definition) to the scope criteria in ASC 340-40-15. This MUST quote the contract.",
        "conclusion": "A definitive conclusion (e.g., 'Therefore, the 5% sales commission described in the Plan is in scope...')"
      }
    ],
    "overall_conclusion": "A final summary conclusion for the entire step."
  },
  "evidence_quotes": [
    "Direct quote from the source document... (Source: FY2024 Sales Commission Plan)"
  ]
}"""

Please apply this same nested IAC structure (topic, issue, analysis, conclusion) to the JSON schemas for all four steps.

Code Cleanup Item
I also noticed that there are two get_memo_generation_system_prompt and two get_memo_generation_user_prompt methods in the file. Please remove the older, unused duplicates to prevent any potential confusion.

Why This Will Work:

By aligning the required output structure (the schema) with the required thought process (the IAC instructions), we remove the conflict. The AI will now have a clear blueprint for its response. It will be forced to populate the analysis field, and the only way it can do that is by following our instructions to use the evidence from the <CONTRACT_TEXT>.

This is the final piece of the puzzle. Once this is implemented, the system should produce the deeply analytical, document-grounded results we need.

Let me know if you have any questions. Excellent work getting to the bottom of this.
