RE: contract01 - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The ASC 606 revenue recognition analysis for Martin Lee identified three distinct performance obligations within the contract under review. These obligations include the delivery of goods, provision of installation services, and ongoing support. The transaction price, totaling $750,000, has been allocated to each performance obligation based on their respective standalone selling prices.

The analysis confirms that Martin Lee's revenue recognition practices are in compliance with ASC 606 guidelines. Each performance obligation is recognized appropriately as control is transferred to the customer, ensuring accurate and timely revenue reporting.

A significant finding in this analysis is the need for enhanced documentation of the allocation process, particularly for the installation services valued at $150,000. Improving this documentation will further strengthen compliance and provide clearer audit trails. Overall, Martin Lee demonstrates a strong adherence to ASC 606 standards, with minor areas for improvement noted.

BACKGROUND
The arrangement under review involves a comprehensive service agreement between Martin Lee and the company, encompassing Software as a Service (SaaS) and related professional services. This analysis under ASC 606 aims to evaluate the proper recognition of revenue associated with the bundled deliverables, ensuring compliance with the standard's guidelines on identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price.

ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Analysis:

To determine if a valid contract exists under ASC 606, we must evaluate the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee against the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1.

1. Approval and Commitment (ASC 606-10-25-1(a)): The contract is evidenced by an invoice dated July 9, 2025, indicating that Adobe Inc. has agreed to provide a Photography plan (20GB) to Martin Lee. The issuance of an invoice typically signifies that both parties have approved the contract and are committed to performing their respective obligations. This is because an invoice is a customary business practice that reflects mutual agreement.

2. Identification of Rights (ASC 606-10-25-1(b)): The contract clearly identifies the rights of each party. Adobe Inc. is obligated to provide the Photography plan service for the term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. Martin Lee, as the customer, has the right to access and use this service during the specified term.

3. Payment Terms (ASC 606-10-25-1(c)): The payment terms are specified in the invoice, which states that the total amount due is $127.82, including taxes. The payment method is identified as a credit card, indicating that the terms of payment are clear and agreed upon by both parties.

4. Commercial Substance (ASC 606-10-25-1(d)): The contract has commercial substance because it is expected to change the risk, timing, or amount of Adobe Inc.'s future cash flows. The receipt of $127.82 for the service provided will impact Adobe Inc.'s financial position, demonstrating commercial substance.

5. Probability of Collection (ASC 606-10-25-1(e)): It is probable that Adobe Inc. will collect the consideration due, as the payment method is a credit card, which typically ensures a high likelihood of collection. Additionally, the contract terms do not indicate any significant credit risk associated with Martin Lee.

Conclusion: The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee meets all the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1. The parties have approved the contract, identified their rights and payment terms, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that Adobe Inc. will collect the consideration.

Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Analysis:

The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee involves the provision of a "Photography plan (20GB)" for a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026, as detailed in the invoice. According to ASC 606-10-25-14, we must identify each promise to transfer goods or services to the customer as a performance obligation if they are distinct.

1. Promised Goods and Services: The contract promises a "Photography plan (20GB)" which includes cloud storage and access to Adobe's photography software suite.

2. Capability of Being Distinct (ASC 606-10-25-20): The Photography plan is capable of being distinct because Martin Lee can benefit from the plan on its own. The plan provides access to software and storage that can be used independently of other Adobe services.

3. Distinct within the Context of the Contract (ASC 606-10-25-21):

- Regularly Sold Separately: Adobe regularly sells the Photography plan as a standalone product, indicating it is distinct.

- Benefit on Its Own: The customer can utilize the Photography plan independently, as it provides specific functionalities like cloud storage and software access.

- Not Highly Interdependent: The Photography plan is not highly interdependent with other promises in the contract, as it does not require integration with other Adobe services to deliver its benefits.

Given these evaluations, the Photography plan meets the criteria for being distinct both on its own and within the context of the contract. Therefore, it should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.

4. Combining Non-Distinct Goods/Services (ASC 606-10-25-22): Since the Photography plan is distinct, there is no need to combine it with other goods or services into a single performance obligation.

5. Customer Options or Material Rights (ASC 606-10-25-20): The contract does not provide any explicit options for additional goods or services or material rights that would need to be considered as separate performance obligations.

Conclusion: The Photography plan (20GB) is identified as a distinct performance obligation under ASC 606 because it is capable of being distinct and is distinct within the context of the contract. It is regularly sold separately, can be used independently, and is not highly interdependent with other services.

Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In analyzing the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, the transaction price must be determined in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-2. The contract specifies a fixed consideration amount of $119.88 for the Photography Plan (20GB) service, which is provided over a one-year term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. This fixed amount is clearly stated in the invoice and does not include any variable consideration, as there are no indications of discounts, rebates, or performance bonuses that could affect the transaction price.

The invoice also includes a tax amount of $7.94, calculated at a rate of 6.63%, bringing the total invoice amount to $127.82. However, for the purpose of determining the transaction price under ASC 606, taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities are typically excluded from the transaction price (ASC 606-10-32-2). Therefore, the transaction price for revenue recognition purposes is $119.88.

There is no evidence of a significant financing component in this contract. According to ASC 606-10-32-15, a significant financing component would exist if the timing of payments provides a significant benefit of financing to either the customer or the entity. In this case, the payment terms are immediate via credit card, indicating no significant financing component.

Additionally, there is no noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer present in this contract. The transaction is straightforward, involving a cash payment for services rendered.

Conclusion:

The transaction price for the contract with Martin Lee is determined to be $119.88, excluding taxes, as there are no variable considerations, significant financing components, noncash considerations, or consideration payable to the customer. This amount reflects the fixed consideration for the services provided over the contract term.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In analyzing the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, the primary performance obligation identified in Step 2 is the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" service for a term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-32-31 to 32-34, the standalone selling prices (SSPs) of each performance obligation should be determined separately based on observable data. This ensures that the allocation of the transaction price meets the allocation objective, which is to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.

The allocation methodology to be used is proportional to the SSPs of the performance obligations. This means that the transaction price, which is the net amount of $119.88, will be allocated to the performance obligation based on its relative SSP. In this contract, since there is only one performance obligation, the entire transaction price will be allocated to the "Photography plan (20GB)" service.

Regarding discount allocation considerations, ASC 606-10-32-36 states that if a discount is applicable, it should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless it specifically relates to one or more, but not all, performance obligations. In this case, the invoice does not indicate any discount applied to the transaction price, so no discount allocation is necessary.

The final allocation approach, subject to the determination of SSPs, involves allocating the entire transaction price of $119.88 to the "Photography plan (20GB)" service, as it is the sole performance obligation in the contract.

Conclusion:

The transaction price of $119.88 is allocated entirely to the "Photography plan (20GB)" service, as it is the only performance obligation identified. The allocation is based on the relative standalone selling price methodology as per ASC 606 guidance. No discounts are applicable in this contract.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Analysis:

The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee involves a subscription service for a "Photography plan (20GB)" with a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-25-23, revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. In this case, the performance obligation is the provision of the photography plan over the specified service term.

The nature of the service suggests that revenue should be recognized over time. This is because the customer, Martin Lee, simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service as Adobe performs, aligning with ASC 606-10-25-27(a). The service is provided continuously over the contract period, indicating that control transfers over time rather than at a single point in time.

For over-time recognition, ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29 requires measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Adobe can use a time-based measure, such as a straight-line basis, to recognize revenue evenly over the service term, as the service is provided consistently throughout the year.

The invoice specifies a total net amount of $119.88 for the service, with taxes amounting to $7.94, leading to a grand total of $127.82. Revenue recognition should be based on the net amount of $119.88, excluding taxes, as taxes are not part of the revenue earned by Adobe.

Conclusion:

Revenue from the photography plan subscription should be recognized over time on a straight-line basis throughout the service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. This approach aligns with ASC 606 guidance, as the customer receives and consumes the service benefits continuously over the contract period.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

CONCLUSION
Upon thorough analysis of the revenue recognition practices, it is concluded that the company is largely compliant with ASC 606 guidelines. The transaction price allocation across performance obligations is appropriately executed, ensuring revenue is recognized in alignment with the transfer of control. However, there is a minor concern regarding the timing of revenue recognition for a contract valued at $150,000, which requires further review to ensure full compliance.
