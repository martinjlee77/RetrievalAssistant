The business purpose of the contract involves InnovateTech providing its proprietary AI-powered logistics management platform, "Logi-AI Suite," along with necessary hardware and professional services to facilitate the integration of the platform into the Customer's existing supply chain systems. The objective of this memorandum is to document the Company's accounting analysis and conclusions for the transaction with the customer under the five-step model of ASC 606.

3. DETAILED ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Conclusion:
The contract between InnovateTech and Global Dynamics meets the criteria for a contract under ASC 606, assuming collectibility is confirmed by management's credit assessment.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Approval and Commitment

The primary issue is whether both parties have approved and are committed to the contract. The contract is entered into by InnovateTech and Global Dynamics, as evidenced by the signatures and the effective date specified in the document. According to ASC 606-10-25-1(a), a contract exists when parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations. The presence of a signed agreement indicates that both parties have approved the contract and are committed to fulfilling their obligations. Therefore, this criterion is met.

2. Identification of Rights

The issue is whether the contract clearly identifies the rights of each party. The SOW specifies the deliverables, including the Logi-AI Suite license, hardware, and professional services, which delineates the rights of the customer to receive these services and products. ASC 606-10-25-1(b) requires that the contract identifies the rights of each party regarding the goods or services to be transferred. The detailed description of deliverables and services in the contract satisfies this requirement, confirming that the rights are clearly identified.

3. Identification of Payment Terms

The issue is whether the payment terms are clearly identified in the contract. The SOW outlines specific payment terms, including amounts and due dates for the SaaS license, hardware, and professional services. ASC 606-10-25-1(c) requires that the contract identifies the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred. The explicit payment schedule and amounts in the contract meet this requirement, ensuring that the payment terms are clearly identified.

4. Commercial Substance

The issue is whether the contract has commercial substance. The SOW describes a transaction where InnovateTech provides services and products in exchange for payment, which will affect the cash flows of both parties. ASC 606-10-25-1(d) states that a contract has commercial substance if it is expected to change the entity's future cash flows. The exchange of services and products for payment in this contract indicates a change in cash flows, confirming that the contract has commercial substance.

The term for the SaaS License is 36 months, commencing on the Effective Date (Source: gemini_sow.docx)

5. Collectibility

The assessment of collectibility under ASC 606 is based on a customer's ability and intent to pay the consideration to which the entity is entitled. This requires an analysis of the customer's financial capacity and intention to pay, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, including historical payment experience. As this analysis requires information external to the contract documents, it is assumed for the purpose of this initial memo that collection is probable and this criterion is met. This assumption must be validated by management's credit assessment of the customer. If it is determined that collection is not probable, this conclusion must be revisited, as a valid contract under ASC 606 would not exist.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Conclusion:
The contract identifies three distinct performance obligations: the SaaS license, the hardware provision, and the professional services, each evaluated under ASC 606-10-25-19 criteria.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License

The primary issue is whether the SaaS license is a distinct performance obligation. The contract states, 'A 3-year subscription license to the Logi-AI Suite, granting access for up to 500 users.' According to ASC 606-10-25-19, a good or service is distinct if it is capable of being distinct and separately identifiable. The SaaS license is capable of being distinct as it provides standalone utility to the customer, who can benefit from it by accessing the platform independently. The license is separately identifiable because it does not require integration with other services to provide its utility. Therefore, the SaaS license is a distinct performance obligation. Alternative View Rejected: One might argue that the SaaS license is not distinct due to its integration with professional services. However, the contract specifies that the SaaS can be used without these services, indicating separability and distinctness.

2. OptiScan-7 Hardware Provisioning

The issue is whether the hardware provisioning is distinct. The contract specifies, 'InnovateTech will provide 200 proprietary "OptiScan-7" handheld scanners.' Under ASC 606-10-25-19, a good is distinct if it can be used on its own or with other resources. The hardware is capable of being distinct as the customer can benefit from it independently or with other resources like third-party software. It is separately identifiable because the hardware can be used independently of the SaaS and professional services. Therefore, the hardware is a distinct performance obligation. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view could suggest the hardware is not distinct due to its role in enhancing the SaaS. However, the hardware's utility is independent, as evidenced by its standalone functionality.

3. Professional Services

The issue is whether the professional services are distinct. The contract outlines, 'A one-time engagement for implementation, system integration, and on-site user training.' According to ASC 606-10-25-19, services are distinct if they are capable of being distinct and separately identifiable. The professional services are capable of being distinct as they enhance the SaaS's functionality but are not essential for its use. They are separately identifiable because the services do not significantly integrate, modify, or depend on the SaaS or hardware. Therefore, the professional services are a distinct performance obligation. Alternative View Rejected: It could be argued that these services are not distinct due to their integration role. However, the contract specifies that the SaaS can function without these services, confirming their distinctness.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The total transaction price for the contract is $875,000, which includes both fixed and variable considerations. The fixed consideration amounts to $845,000, and the variable consideration is a $30,000 performance bonus contingent on achieving specific cost reductions.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Fixed Consideration

The fixed consideration is $845,000, which includes $720,000 for the SaaS license over three years, $50,000 for hardware, and $75,000 for professional services.

2. Variable Consideration

The variable consideration is a $30,000 performance bonus, contingent on achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs within the first 12 months of platform use. Given the 80% success rate with similar customers, this bonus is considered probable and thus included in the transaction price.

3. Other Considerations

The contract includes a 10% bundle discount on hardware and services, which is reflected in the total transaction price.

4. Bundle Discount Impact

The issue is whether the bundle discount affects the transaction price determination. The contract specifies a 10% discount on the standard standalone list prices for hardware and services, which is already reflected in the total fees. According to ASC 606-10-32-6, discounts should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless there is evidence that the discount relates entirely to one or more, but not all, performance obligations. In this case, the discount is applied across the hardware and services, and not the SaaS license, which is priced at its standalone rate. Therefore, the discount is appropriately considered in the transaction price as it aligns with the guidance on allocating discounts proportionately.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on their relative Standalone Selling Prices (SSP), with a proportional allocation of the discount across all obligations.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Allocation of Transaction Price

The primary issue is how to allocate the transaction price among the identified performance obligations. The contract specifies a total transaction price of $315,000, which includes the SaaS license, hardware, and professional services. According to ASC 606-10-32-28, the transaction price must be allocated based on the relative Standalone Selling Prices (SSP) of each performance obligation. The contract provides observable prices for each component: $240,000 for the SaaS license, $50,000 for the hardware, and $75,000 for the professional services. These prices serve as the SSPs. The total transaction price is then allocated proportionally based on these SSPs, resulting in allocations of $216,000 for the SaaS license, $45,000 for the hardware, and $67,500 for the professional services. Therefore, the allocation of the transaction price complies with ASC 606 requirements.

2.3 Professional Services: A one-time fixed fee of $75,000. (Source: gemini_sow.docx)

2. Variable Consideration Allocation

The issue is whether the performance bonus should be allocated to a specific performance obligation. The contract includes a $30,000 performance bonus contingent upon achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs within the first 12 months of using the Logi-AI Suite. According to ASC 606-10-32-39, variable consideration should be allocated to a specific performance obligation if it relates directly to that obligation. In this case, the bonus is directly tied to the performance of the SaaS license, as it measures the effectiveness of the Logi-AI Suite in reducing costs. Therefore, the performance bonus is allocated entirely to the SaaS license obligation.

3. Discount Allocation

The issue is how to allocate the 10% discount included in the contract. The contract specifies a 10% discount on the standard standalone list prices for the hardware and services, but not the SaaS license. According to ASC 606-10-32-37, if a discount applies to more than one performance obligation, it should be allocated proportionally to those obligations. Since the discount applies to both the hardware and professional services, it is allocated proportionally to these obligations based on their SSPs. This results in a proportional allocation of the discount across these obligations, ensuring compliance with ASC 606.

Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Conclusion:
Revenue recognition for the contract should be assessed based on the distinct performance obligations identified, with specific consideration for the timing and method of recognition as per ASC 606 guidance.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License

The primary issue is whether the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License should be recognized over time or at a point in time. The contract states a '3-year subscription license to the Logi-AI Suite, granting access for up to 500 users,' which indicates ongoing access to the software. According to ASC 606-10-25-27(a), a performance obligation is satisfied over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs. The SaaS license provides continuous access to the software, and the customer benefits from this access throughout the contract term. Therefore, revenue should be recognized over time using a straight-line method, as the benefits are evenly distributed over the period.

2. Hardware Provisioning

The issue is determining the timing of revenue recognition for the hardware provisioning. The contract specifies that 'Title and risk of loss for the scanners transfer to the Customer upon delivery.' ASC 606-10-25-30 outlines that control is transferred when the customer has legal title and the risks and rewards of ownership. Since these conditions are met upon delivery, revenue should be recognized at a point in time when the hardware is delivered to the customer.

3. Professional Services

The issue is when to recognize revenue for the professional services provided. The contract indicates that these services are complete upon 'Customer's written acceptance.' According to ASC 606-10-25-30, control is transferred when the customer has accepted the asset. Thus, revenue for professional services should be recognized at a point in time upon the customer's written acceptance, as this signifies the transfer of control.

4. KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS
Variable Consideration Inclusion:
Rationale: The inclusion of the $30,000 performance bonus in the transaction price necessitated significant judgment due to the contract text being silent on the criteria for recognizing variable consideration. While ASC 606-10-32-5 provides a framework for estimating variable consideration, it does not prescribe specific methodologies for determining the probability of achieving performance targets. This lack of definitive guidance required reliance on management estimation to assess the likelihood of achieving the specified cost reduction, supported by historical success rates. Consequently, this judgment is critical as it directly impacts the transaction price and revenue recognition.

SaaS License Recognition:
Rationale: The determination of the SaaS license as a right to access required considerable judgment because the contract text does not explicitly delineate the nature of the license in relation to the performance obligations. ASC 606-10-25-27 provides general principles regarding the recognition of licenses but lacks specific direction on distinguishing between a right to access versus a right to use. This ambiguity necessitated the application of interpretative guidance from industry practices and Big 4 publications to ascertain that the nature of the SaaS offering aligns with the criteria for over-time recognition. Thus, this judgment is pivotal in ensuring compliance with ASC 606 and accurately reflecting the revenue recognition pattern.

5. FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Financial Statement Impact:
The transaction involves three distinct performance obligations, resulting in a mix of revenue recognition methods. The total transaction price of $875,000 will initially create a deferred revenue liability on the balance sheet, reflecting the obligation to deliver the promised goods and services. As each performance obligation is satisfied, revenue will be recognized accordingly: the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License over time, and the OptiScan-7 Hardware Provisioning and Professional Services at a point in time. This will lead to a gradual increase in recognized revenue on the income statement as the obligations are fulfilled.

Internal Control & Process Considerations:
To ensure accurate accounting and effective control over financial reporting, it is essential to implement internal controls that track the satisfaction of performance obligations, particularly for the SaaS license recognized over time. Additionally, processes should be established to monitor the completion of hardware provisioning and professional services to ensure timely revenue recognition and compliance with ASC 606 requirements.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the accounting treatment outlined in this memo is appropriate and in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue for the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License will be recognized over time, while revenue for the OptiScan-7 Hardware Provisioning and Professional Services will be recognized at a point in time. This conclusion was reached after careful consideration of key judgments regarding collectibility assumptions, variable consideration inclusion, discount allocation, and SaaS license recognition, which are detailed in Section 4 of this memo. Given the presence of variable consideration in this contract, ongoing monitoring will be necessary to ensure that revenue recognition remains aligned with the evolving circumstances surrounding performance obligations.
