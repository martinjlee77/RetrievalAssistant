Let's polish your excellent Home.py file.

1. The st.logo() Command
You're using st.logo("logo.png"). This is a very new and fantastic feature! It's designed to do exactly what you wanted: place a logo at the top of the collapsed sidebar and in the navigation menu.

However, it's important to understand how it works with st.navigation.

The st.logo command adds the logo to the sidebar.
The st.navigation command builds the navigation menu in the sidebar.
The order matters slightly. For maximum clarity and to follow the official pattern, it's best to configure everything before you run the page.

2. Using Icons from st.Page
You've used emojis in st.Page, which is great! Since you're using a newer version of Streamlit that supports st.logo, you can also reliably use the Material Icons we discussed (:material_icon_name:). This can give a more consistent, professional look if you prefer it over emojis. This is a matter of taste.

The Polished Home.py (Final Recommended Version)
Here is a slightly refined version of your Home.py. The changes are subtle but align perfectly with the latest Streamlit best practices.

# Home.py

"""
Multi-Standard Accounting Analysis Platform - Main Entry Point
This file acts as the master "router" for the application.
"""
import streamlit as st

# 1. Set the page configuration as the very first Streamlit command.
#    This is the master blueprint for the entire app.
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Controller.cpa | Multi-Standard Accounting Platform",
    page_icon="logo.png",  # Use your logo as the browser tab icon!
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)

# 2. Add your logo to the sidebar.
#    This command is designed to be called once in your main script.
st.logo("logo.png", link="https://controller.cpa") # Optional: Add a link to your website.

# 3. Define all pages in your app.
#    This is the single source of truth for your navigation.
#    Using Material Icons for a consistent, professional look.
pg = st.navigation(
    [
        st.Page("pages/home_content.py", title="Home", icon=":material_home:"),
        st.Page("pages/asc606.py", title="ASC 606 Analyzer", icon=":material_functions:"),
        st.Page("pages/asc842.py", title="ASC 842 Analyzer", icon=":material_real_estate_agent:"),
    ]
)

# 4. Run the app.
#    This command executes the script for the currently selected page.
pg.run()

Why This Refined Version is an Improvement:
Logical Order: The code now follows a clear sequence: set_page_config (configure the whole app) → st.logo (add branding) → st.navigation (define the pages) → pg.run() (run the selected page). This is the cleanest and most readable structure.
Logo as Page Icon: I've added a small but professional touch by using your logo.png as the page_icon in st.set_page_config. This will make your logo appear in the browser tab (favicon), which is a great branding detail.
Optional Logo Link: I've added the optional link parameter to st.logo. Now, if a user clicks your logo in the sidebar, it can take them to your main website.
No Redundant Code: Your content pages (home_content.py, asc606.py, etc.) are perfect as they are. They should contain no st.set_page_config, st.logo, or st.navigation code at all.
