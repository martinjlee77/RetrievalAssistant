ok let's rethink this. can we keep this simple and use standard streamlit features. what about using the standard navigation menu that includes home and just show the home page with the side navigation displayed. also, other asc 606 landing pages are listed there. that way, there is no need for this complex cards. i didn't realize that it was this hard to get hover over to work on streamlit. again, i want to use the standard features to create a professional app here.

You are absolutely right. Let's do that.

This is a fantastic and professional pivot. The core strength of Streamlit is its ability to create clean, functional, and professional-looking data apps quickly and simply. The moment we start fighting the framework with complex CSS to mimic traditional web design, we lose its main advantages: speed, stability, and maintainability.

Your suggestion to embrace the standard navigation menu is the correct path forward. It aligns perfectly with Streamlit's design philosophy and will result in a more robust and professional application.

The New Strategy: The "Professional & Standard" Approach
Embrace the Sidebar: The sidebar is Streamlit's native navigation hub. We will use it as the primary way for users to move between the Home dashboard and the different ASC analysis tools.
Simplify the Home Page: The home page no longer needs to be the navigation menu. Its new purpose is to be a clean, welcoming dashboard that provides a high-level overview and directs users to the main tools.
Use st.page_link: We will use this standard, modern Streamlit component to create clear "call-to-action" links on the home page.
Eliminate Complex CSS: We will remove almost all the custom CSS, especially the hacks for hover effects and layout. This will make the app faster and immune to breaking on future Streamlit updates.
Step 1: Ensure Your File Structure is Correct
For Streamlit's standard navigation to work, your project must have this structure:

your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home.py             <-- The main dashboard page you're designing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_ASC_606_Revenue.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_ASC_842_Leases.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (and so on)

Streamlit will automatically read the files in the pages directory and create the sidebar navigation menu for you. The numbers (1_, 2_) control the order.

Step 2: The New, Simplified Home.py
Here is the complete code for your new home page. It is dramatically simpler, uses only standard features, and looks incredibly professional.

Copy and paste this entire block to replace your current Home.py file.

What This New Approach Gives You
Zero Hacks, 100% Stability: This code uses zero fragile HTML/CSS workarounds for layout or navigation. It will be stable and work perfectly with future Streamlit updates.
Effortless Navigation: Streamlit builds the sidebar menu for you automatically. When you add pages/3_ASC_815_Derivatives.py, it will just appear in the menu. No code changes needed on the home page.
Professional & Clean UI: The layout with st.container(border=True) and st.page_link looks clean, modern, and professional. It clearly communicates what the user can do without any confusing hover effects.
Radical Simplicity: The code is now incredibly simple, easy to read, and easy to modify. This is the true power of Streamlit.
Excellent Performance: Without the large, complex CSS block, the page will load faster.
You've made the right call. This simplified, standard approach is undoubtedly the best way to build a high-quality, professional Streamlit application.
