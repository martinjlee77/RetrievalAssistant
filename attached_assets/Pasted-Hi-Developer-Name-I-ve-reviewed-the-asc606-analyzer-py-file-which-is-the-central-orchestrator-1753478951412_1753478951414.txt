Hi [Developer Name],

I've reviewed the asc606_analyzer.py file, which is the central orchestrator for our analysis. The structure is clear, and it correctly uses the prompt.py and llm.py modules to generate a response. The way it handles the debug configuration is also well-implemented.

I have a few key areas of feedback and suggestions for improvement that will make this module much more robust and powerful, bringing it in line with our full vision for a RAG-powered system."

1. (High Priority) The Parsing Logic is Too Brittle
Observation: The _parse_analysis_response method relies on the LLM returning a perfectly formatted JSON block. This is notoriously unreliable. LLMs often add introductory text ("Here is the JSON you requested...") or trailing remarks, which will break the json.loads() call.

Business Impact: If parsing fails, the user gets a degraded experience where the five-step summary just says "See detailed analysis in professional memo." This reduces the value of the dashboard.

Comment for Developer: "The current JSON parsing logic is a great start, but it's too brittle for production. We need to make two key improvements:

Instruct the LLM to only output JSON. Modify the prompt to be more forceful about the output format.
Make the parsing code more resilient. It should be able to find and extract a JSON object even if it's surrounded by other text.
Code Suggestion:

In llm.py: Update make_llm_call to use OpenAI's native JSON Mode.
# In llm.py
def make_llm_call(...):
    # ...
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=openai_messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        # --- NEW: Add this line for reliable JSON output ---
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )

In prompt.py: Add an instruction to the prompt telling the AI to use JSON.
# At the end of the main analysis prompt in prompt.py
# ...
Format your entire response as a single JSON object. The JSON object should have top-level keys like "step1", "step2", "memo", "citations", etc.

In asc606_analyzer.py: Update the parser to be more robust.
# Replace the simple parser with a more resilient one
import re

def _parse_analysis_response(self, response: str) -> ASC606Analysis:
    try:
        # Use regex to find the JSON block, even with surrounding text
        json_match = re.search(r"```json\s*(\{.*?\})\s*```", response, re.DOTALL)
        if json_match:
            json_content = json_match.group(1)
        else:
            # Fallback for if the LLM just returns raw JSON without ```
            json_content = response[response.find('{'):response.rfind('}')+1]

        parsed_data = json.loads(json_content)

        # Now create the ASC606Analysis object...
        return ASC606Analysis(...)

    except Exception as e:
        # ... existing error handling ...

2. (Strategic) Implement the RAG Workflow
Observation: The analyzer is currently just using a static prompt. It's not performing the "Retrieval" step from our RAG design.

Business Impact: The analysis is based only on the LLM's general knowledge, not on our specific, authoritative knowledge base. This limits the quality, accuracy, and defensibility of the memos. Activating RAG is the single biggest upgrade we can make to the application.

Comment for Developer: "This is our most important next step. The current analyzer is working in a direct prompt-to-LLM mode. We need to implement the full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow we designed.

Please modify the analyze_contract method to include these steps:

Initialize the knowledge base by calling get_knowledge_base() from llm.py.
Before creating the main prompt, use the contract text to extract key terms using extract_contract_terms().
Use these key terms to query the knowledge base and retrieve the most relevant paragraphs from our ASC 606 sources.
Inject these retrieved paragraphs as "Retrieved Context" into the main prompt before sending it to the LLM. This will ground the AI's response in our authoritative sources."
3. (Code Quality) Legacy and Unused Code
Observation: The file contains several methods that seem to be remnants of a previous version or are not currently used, such as analyze_document, get_knowledge_base_stats, and validate_analysis_quality.
Business Impact: Unused code adds clutter and can be confusing for future maintenance.
Comment for Developer: "I've noticed a few methods like get_knowledge_base_stats and validate_analysis_quality that don't seem to be called anywhere in our current workflow. Let's either integrate them (for example, we could display the knowledge base stats in the debug sidebar) or remove them to keep the codebase clean."
This feedback provides a clear path forward: first, fix the brittle parsing; second, implement the game-changing RAG workflow; and third, clean up the code. This will transform your analyzer from a good proof-of-concept into a truly powerful and reliable analysis engine.
