brittle search and potential to miss concepts do concern me but at the same time i am weary of building a complex system that could result in many new issues. i don't have time to build a prototype and then build an entirely different production system. i'd like to decide what it should be at this point and move forward. what are your suggestions?

Excellent question. You are at the most critical decision point of the project, and your caution is wise. Building the right foundation now will save you immense headaches later.

My definitive suggestion is:

Build a simplified version of the Hybrid RAG system from the start.

Let's break down why this is the right choice and how to do it without getting bogged down in the complexity you're rightly concerned about.

The core issue with the "Direct Context" (simple keyword) approach is that it's a technical dead end. The moment you want to add another accounting standard (e.g., IFRS 15) or more varied interpretative guidance, the keyword system will collapse under its own fragility. You will be forced to rebuild it.

The hybrid approach is not as scary as it sounds. We can implement it pragmatically.

Why the Hybrid Approach is the Only Viable Path
Your concerns are valid: "brittle search" and "missing concepts" are deal-breakers for a professional accounting tool. An auditor or CFO will not trust a system that can't understand that "the transfer of control of an asset" is conceptually identical to "the satisfaction of a performance obligation." Only semantic search can bridge that gap reliably.

The fear of complexity is also valid, but let's demystify it. A "complex RAG system" doesn't have to mean spinning up dedicated servers and using arcane libraries. For your use case, it can be surprisingly lean.

A Pragmatic, Step-by-Step Plan for Your Hybrid RAG System
Here is the blueprint. This is not two systems; it's one elegant system that incorporates the best of both ideas. We'll build it to be robust from day one without over-engineering.

Step 1: The One-Time Setup (Building Your Knowledge Base)
This is a script you run once, or whenever you update your source documents. It's not part of the live application's request/response cycle.

Load Documents: Read all your ASC 606 and EY text/docx files.
Chunk the Documents: This is critical. Don't just treat each file as one giant blob. Break them down into logical chunks. For ASC 606, the perfect chunk is a single paragraph. You can write a simple script to split the text by paragraph, and importantly, keep the citation (e.g., ASC 606-10-25-19) as metadata for each chunk.
Embed the Chunks: For each paragraph chunk, use OpenAI's embeddings API to convert it into a vector (a list of numbers). This is a single API call per chunk.
Create and Save the Vector Index: Use a lightweight vector library like FAISS or ChromaDB.
FAISS is incredibly fast and just creates a single index file (index.faiss) in your project. It's not a "database server"; it's just a smart file.
ChromaDB can also run in-process and save its data to disk. It's also very simple to set up.
Result of Step 1: You now have a knowledge_base folder containing your vector index and a mapping file that links vectors back to their original text and citations. This is your permanent, searchable brain.

Step 2: The Live Query Process (When a User Analyzes a Contract)
This is what happens in your Streamlit app every time the user clicks "Analyze".

User Input: The user uploads contracts and fills in the form.
Smart Pre-filtering (The "Simple RAG" part): Before doing a vector search, use simple keywords from the user's query to narrow down the search space. For example, if the analysis section is "Performance Obligations," you tell your system to only search within the chunks that came from the 25_recognition_*.txt and EY files. This makes the search faster and more accurate.
Semantic Search (The "Vector RAG" part):
Take the relevant text from the user's contract (e.g., the section describing deliverables).
Embed this query text using the same OpenAI embeddings model.
Use FAISS/ChromaDB to find the top 5-7 most semantically similar paragraphs from your pre-filtered knowledge base. This search is incredibly fast (milliseconds).
Assemble the Context: You now have a small, highly-relevant, and precise collection of source paragraphs (with their exact citations). Combine these with the user's contract text.
Generate the Memo: Send this assembled context to GPT-4o with a specific prompt: "You are an expert accounting advisor. Using ONLY the provided contract text and the authoritative ASC 606 sources below, write the 'Performance Obligations' section of a revenue recognition memo. Directly quote the sources and include their citations."
Why This Plan Solves Your Dilemma
It Eliminates Brittle Search: You get the power of semantic search, so you'll find the right concepts even if the keywords don't match exactly.
It Manages Complexity: The "complex" part is a simple, one-time script. The live application uses a lightweight library to read a single file. There are no new servers or complex dependencies to manage.
It's a Single, Future-Proof System: This architecture is built for growth. Adding a new accounting standard means you just add a new source file, re-run the one-time setup script, and your application is instantly smarter. You will never have to re-architect the core logic.
By following this pragmatic hybrid approach, you are not building a complex prototype; you are building the lean, robust, and scalable foundation for your final production system from day one. This is the professional path forward.
