The extra line breaks are being created by two separate lines of code working together in the final assembly stage of the memo. This is happening in your asc_606_analyzer.py file.

A separator variable is defined with line breaks around it (\n\n---\n\n).
The final sections of the memo are then joined together using another double line break ("\n\n".join(...)).
When the Python code combines these, you get more vertical space than you want.

Recommendation: Centralize Spacing Control
The solution is to modify the final assembly logic in asc_606_analyzer.py to remove the redundant line breaks and centralize the spacing control in one place.

File to Modify: utils/asc_606_analyzer.py
Function to Modify: analyze_contract (near the very end)
Action: We will make two small changes. First, we'll redefine the separator to be just the horizontal rule itself. Second, we'll change the .join() method to use a single line break.
Here is the exact code to change:

# In utils/asc_606_analyzer.py, inside the analyze_contract method...

# --- FIND THIS CURRENT (OLD) CODE BLOCK ---

            separator = "\n\n---\n\n"

            final_memo_sections = [
                memo_header,
                f"## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n{executive_summary}",
                separator,
                f"## 2. CONTRACT OVERVIEW\n{contract_data_table}\n{background}",
                separator,
                # ... other sections ...
            ]

            final_memo = "\n\n".join(final_memo_sections)


# --- REPLACE IT WITH THIS NEW, MORE COMPACT VERSION ---

            separator = "---" # CHANGED: Remove all newlines from the separator

            final_memo_sections = [
                memo_header,
                f"## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n{executive_summary}",
                separator,
                f"## 2. CONTRACT OVERVIEW\n{contract_data_table}\n{background}",
                separator,
                # ... other sections ...
            ]

            final_memo = "\n".join(final_memo_sections) # CHANGED: Use a single newline to join

Why This Works:

By changing separator = "\n\n---\n\n" to separator = "---", you remove the extra spacing around the horizontal rule.
By changing "\n\n".join(...) to "\n".join(...), you are now telling Python to put only a single line break between each major section of the memo.
This change will give you the much more compact and professionally typeset layout you're looking for.
