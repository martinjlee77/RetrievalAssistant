
Here’s a focused, section-by-section review of contact.html with clear, practical edits. I’ve included ready-to-paste copy where useful.

Overall verdict

Solid structure and a strong unified form. A few inconsistencies (CTA labels, emails, anchors) and missing reassurance/details that enterprise buyers expect. Add small UX touches to speed qualified requests and reduce back-and-forth.
Head/SEO

Keep but consider aligning with the rest of the site previews.
Suggested tags:
Title: Contact — VeritasLogic.ai
Meta description: Contact us for demos, professional services, enterprise pricing, or support. We respond within 4 business hours.
Add canonical and OG/Twitter tags like index.html for clean share previews.
Navigation

Inconsistencies with your sitewide CTA choice.
Fixes:
Change “Sign Up” to “Start Risk Free” and link to #contact-form.
Ensure mobile menu script is loaded and working on this page.
Contact Header

Clear. Add SLA and preferred audience to increase confidence.
Suggested subcopy:
“We respond within 4 business hours (Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm PT). For demo requests, include your time zone and ideal times.”
Unified Contact Form

Strong layout and conditional fields. Add a few enterprise qualifiers and reassurance.

Additions:

Add optional fields many enterprises expect:
Phone (optional), Time zone, Country/Region
Standards of interest (multi-select): ASC 606, 340‑40, 842 (Lessee), 718, 805, 815 (Coming Soon)
For demo-request: Preferred dates/times; video platform preference (Teams/Zoom/Google Meet)
For enterprise-sales: Procurement stage (exploring/budgeted/in process), security requirements (NDA, DPA)
Add privacy reassurance and consent microcopy under the form:
“We’ll only use your information to respond to your inquiry. See our Privacy Policy.”
Add a small trust line:
“No file uploads here. For demos, we can review a redacted sample under NDA if needed.”
Ready-to-paste microcopy:

Under the button: “We’ll respond within 4 business hours (Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm PT).”
Privacy note (below the note above): “We respect your privacy. By submitting, you agree to our Privacy Policy.”
Conditional fields logic and labels

Memo Rerun:
Good. Add a brief scope note to match pricing page language:
“Covers input corrections or extractable text issues. Methodology changes or expanded scope may require a new analysis.”
Consider adding a small “additional fees may apply” note for High/Urgent to set expectations.
Demo Request:
Add fields for time zone and preferred times (optional).
Enterprise Sales:
Add a question: “Security review needed? (NDA, DPA, vendor form)” as a checkbox or select.
Form UX enhancements (optional but high-impact)

Quick-select chips above the form that preselect the inquiry type and scroll to the form:
“Schedule a Live Demo,” “Enterprise Sales,” “Professional Services,” “Memo Rerun,” “Support”
Each chip onclick calls selectInquiryType('…').
Autocomplete attributes for fields to improve fill speed:
name: autocomplete="name"; email: autocomplete="email"; company: autocomplete="organization"; role: autocomplete="organization-title".
Input validation hints:
For “role,” placeholder is good; consider a datalist with common roles if you like.
Submission behavior and messages

Success message is fine. Consider replacing alert with an inline success state above the form for a smoother experience.
Error email must use the official address:
Replace hello@veritaslogic.ai with support@veritaslogic.ai in the catch block.
Consider a line stating expected next steps after success (demo: “We’ll propose 2–3 demo times”).
Footer

Several inconsistencies to fix:
Platform: “Demo” → contact.html#contact-form (features.html#demo doesn’t exist)
“Free Trial” → “Start Risk Free” and link to #contact-form
Support email: ensure support@veritaslogic.ai everywhere (currently shows hello@ in JS and Support link)
“Security” → features.html#security and label as “Security Overview” for consistency
Consistency checklist

CTA wording: Use “Start Risk Free” everywhere.
Email: Use support@veritaslogic.ai everywhere (footer, JS error, support link).
Anchors: Use contact.html#contact-form (replace #trial).
SLA: Use “within 4 business hours (Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm PT)” consistently across contact/demos.

Optional enhancements

Add a “Schedule now” link to a calendar (e.g., Calendly) when inquiry type = demo-request; reveal a “Schedule a live demo now” button that opens your calendar.
Add a honeypot input or basic trap text to reduce spam (invisible field).
After successful submit, show an inline message with next steps instead of alert: “Thanks—your request is in. We’ll reply within 4 business hours with next steps and proposed times.”
