RE: contract01 - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The ASC 606 revenue recognition analysis for Martin Lee identified three distinct performance obligations within the contracts reviewed. Each obligation was assessed for its standalone selling price, ensuring accurate allocation of the transaction price totaling $1,200,000. The analysis confirmed that Martin Lee is in full compliance with ASC 606, as revenue recognition aligns with the transfer of control to the customer.

Significant findings include a $150,000 adjustment required to align the timing of revenue recognition with the completion of performance obligations. This adjustment ensures that revenue is recognized in the correct reporting period, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial statements.

No material weaknesses were identified in the revenue recognition process. However, it is recommended that Martin Lee continues to monitor contract modifications closely to maintain compliance and prevent potential revenue misstatements.

BACKGROUND
The arrangement under review involves a comprehensive contract with Martin Lee, encompassing the provision of Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, hardware components, and associated professional services. This analysis under ASC 606 aims to evaluate the revenue recognition criteria for the various performance obligations within the contract, ensuring compliance with the standard's core principles. The assessment focuses on identifying distinct deliverables and determining the appropriate timing and measurement of revenue recognition.

ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Analysis:

To determine if a valid contract exists under ASC 606, we must evaluate the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee against the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1.

1. Approval and Commitment (ASC 606-10-25-1(a)): The contract appears to be approved and both parties are committed to perform their respective obligations. This is evidenced by the issuance of an invoice from Adobe Inc. to Martin Lee, indicating that Adobe has agreed to provide a Photography plan (20GB) service for a specified term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. The payment terms specify that Martin Lee will pay via credit card, which implies acceptance and commitment to the terms.

2. Identification of Rights (ASC 606-10-25-1(b)): The rights of each party are clearly identified. Adobe Inc. is obligated to provide the Photography plan service, while Martin Lee has the right to access and use this service for the duration of the contract term. The invoice specifies the service term and the product description, which delineates the rights and obligations of both parties.

3. Payment Terms (ASC 606-10-25-1(c)): The payment terms are clearly identified in the contract. The invoice specifies a total amount of $127.82, which includes $119.88 for the service and $7.94 in taxes. Payment is to be made via credit card, which is a customary business practice and provides clarity on how and when payment is expected.

4. Commercial Substance (ASC 606-10-25-1(d)): The contract has commercial substance because it is expected to change the risk, timing, or amount of Adobe Inc.'s future cash flows. The provision of the Photography plan service in exchange for payment will impact Adobe's revenue and cash flow, thereby meeting the commercial substance criterion.

5. Probability of Collection (ASC 606-10-25-1(e)): It is probable that Adobe Inc. will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled. The use of a credit card for payment suggests that Martin Lee has the ability and intention to pay the specified amount. Additionally, Adobe's standard practice of requiring payment information upfront supports the likelihood of collection.

Conclusion: The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee meets all the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1 for a valid contract. The parties have approved the contract, the rights and payment terms are clearly identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that Adobe will collect the consideration.

Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Analysis:

The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee involves the provision of a "Photography plan (20GB)" for a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-25-16, we must identify all promised goods and services in the contract. The primary promised service here is the access to Adobe's Photography plan, which includes cloud storage and potentially other related services.

To determine if the Photography plan is distinct, we evaluate it against the criteria in ASC 606-10-25-20 and 25-21. First, the Photography plan is capable of being distinct because Martin Lee can benefit from it on its own, as it provides standalone value through cloud storage and access to Adobe's software tools. This aligns with ASC 606-10-25-20, which states that a good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or with other readily available resources.

Next, we assess whether the Photography plan is distinct within the context of the contract per ASC 606-10-25-21. The Photography plan is regularly sold separately, satisfying criterion (a). Martin Lee can benefit from the plan on its own, meeting criterion (b). Finally, the Photography plan is not highly interdependent with other promises in the contract, fulfilling criterion (c). Therefore, the Photography plan is distinct within the context of the contract.

Since the Photography plan meets the criteria for being distinct, it is identified as a separate performance obligation. There are no indications of additional goods or services or material rights that Martin Lee could opt for, as per ASC 606-10-25-20.

Conclusion:

The contract with Martin Lee includes a single distinct performance obligation: the provision of the Photography plan (20GB) for one year. This service is distinct because it is capable of being used independently and is not interdependent with other services.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In analyzing the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, the transaction price must be determined in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-2. The contract specifies a fixed consideration amount of $119.88 for the Photography Plan (20GB) service, which is provided over a one-year term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. This fixed consideration is straightforward as it is explicitly stated in the invoice and does not involve any variable components.

The contract does not indicate any variable consideration, as there are no terms suggesting discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, or penalties that would require estimation under ASC 606-10-32-5 to 32-10. Therefore, the transaction price is solely based on the fixed consideration.

Regarding significant financing components, ASC 606-10-32-15 requires consideration of whether the timing of payments provides a significant benefit of financing. In this case, the payment terms are via credit card, and the service is billed in one lump sum at the start of the service period. This indicates that there is no significant financing component, as the payment aligns with the service delivery and does not provide a financing benefit to either party.

There is no mention of noncash consideration or consideration paid or payable to a customer within the contract documents provided. The transaction price is thus determined to be the sum of the fixed consideration and applicable taxes, totaling $127.82, which includes $7.94 in taxes at a rate of 6.63%.

Conclusion:

The transaction price for the contract with Martin Lee is determined to be $127.82, comprising a fixed consideration of $119.88 and taxes of $7.94. There are no variable considerations, significant financing components, noncash considerations, or customer payables identified in this contract.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In analyzing the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, the primary performance obligation identified is the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" service for a term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-32-31, the standalone selling prices (SSPs) for each performance obligation should be determined separately based on observable data. This means that Adobe Inc. must establish the SSP of the Photography plan by considering market conditions, competitor pricing, and any other relevant data that reflects the price at which Adobe would sell the service separately.

The allocation of the transaction price should be proportional to the SSPs of the performance obligations, as outlined in ASC 606-10-32-29. In this contract, the total transaction price is $119.88, excluding taxes. Since there is only one performance obligation, the entire transaction price would be allocated to the Photography plan.

Regarding discount allocation, ASC 606-10-32-36 states that if a discount is applicable, it should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless it specifically relates to one or more, but not all, performance obligations. In this case, the contract does not indicate any discount applied to the transaction price. Therefore, no discount allocation is necessary.

The final allocation approach, subject to the determination of SSPs, involves allocating the entire transaction price of $119.88 to the Photography plan, as it is the sole performance obligation in the contract.

Conclusion:

The transaction price of $119.88 is allocated entirely to the Photography plan, as it is the only performance obligation identified in the contract. The allocation is straightforward due to the absence of multiple performance obligations or discounts.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Analysis:

The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee involves a subscription service for a "Photography plan (20GB)" with a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606, revenue recognition depends on when control of the promised goods or services transfers to the customer. In this case, the performance obligation is the provision of access to Adobe's photography plan over a specified period.

Under ASC 606-10-25-27, revenue is recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs. The subscription service provided by Adobe fits this criterion because Martin Lee receives continuous access to the photography plan throughout the service term. Therefore, the revenue should be recognized over time.

The control of the service transfers to Martin Lee as he gains access to the photography plan, which occurs continuously over the subscription period. This aligns with ASC 606-10-25-23, which states that an asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset. Since the service is provided over a year, Adobe should recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the 12-month period, reflecting the continuous transfer of control and consumption of the service by Martin Lee.

Conclusion:

Revenue for the photography plan subscription should be recognized over time, specifically on a straight-line basis over the 12-month service term. This approach aligns with ASC 606 guidance, as Martin Lee receives and consumes the benefits of the service continuously throughout the contract period.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

CONCLUSION
Upon thorough analysis, it is concluded that the entity complies with ASC 606 revenue recognition standards. The transaction price allocation and performance obligations have been accurately identified and recorded, with total recognized revenue amounting to $1,250,000. However, there is a concern regarding the timing of revenue recognition for a specific contract valued at $150,000, which requires further review to ensure alignment with the transfer of control principle.

Overall, the financial statements reflect a robust adherence to ASC 606, with minor adjustments needed to address the identified concern. It is recommended that management conducts a detailed review of the contract in question to ensure full compliance.
