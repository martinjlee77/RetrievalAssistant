1. Parallel Processing
Simple Implementation Option:

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# In analyze_contract(), replace the for loop with:
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:  # 2 workers to avoid API rate limits
    futures = {
        executor.submit(
            self._analyze_step,
            step_num=step_num,
            contract_text=contract_text,
            authoritative_context=authoritative_context,
            customer_name=customer_name
        ): step_num
        for step_num in range(1, 6)
    }

    for future in futures:
        step_num = futures[future]
        try:
            results['steps'][f'step_{step_num}'] = future.result()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in Step {step_num}: {str(e)}")
            results['steps'][f'step_{step_num}'] = {
                'title': self._get_step_title(step_num),
                'analysis': f"Error: {str(e)}",
                'conclusion': "Analysis incomplete"
            }

Pros:

Minimal code changes
Uses Python's built-in concurrent.futures
2-3x speedup (API calls are the bottleneck)
Cons:

OpenAI API has rate limits (~3-10 requests/minute depending on your plan)
Add time.sleep(10) between batches if you hit limits
Recommendation: Start with max_workers=2 to test. Monitor API usage in OpenAI dashboard.

2. Error Recovery
Simple Retry Logic:

max_retries = 2
for step_num in range(1, 6):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            step_result = self._analyze_step(...)
            break  # Success - exit retry loop
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:  # Final attempt
                logger.error(f"Failed Step {step_num} after {max_retries} attempts: {str(e)}")
                results['steps'][f'step_{step_num}'] = {...error dict...}
            else:
                logger.warning(f"Retrying Step {step_num} (attempt {attempt + 1})")
                time.sleep(2)  # Wait before retry

Pros:

Only 5 lines of added code
Handles transient API errors (timeouts, rate limits)
Cons:

Won’t fix logical errors in your code
Recommendation: Add this only if you frequently see transient API errors in logs.

3. Progress Tracking
You’re correct - if asc606_page.py already shows progress, no need to duplicate. Good call keeping it simple!

For reference, the existing progress tracking in asc606_page.py is sufficient:

steps = ["Starting", "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Step 4", "Step 5", "Memo Generation"]
ui.analysis_progress(steps, current_step)

4. Memory Usage
When It Becomes an Issue:

Text size: OpenAI’s API has a ~128,000 token limit (~96,000 words) for gpt-4o.
Contract size: Problems start at ~50-100 pages (typical contracts are 10-30 pages).
Your risk: Only if analyzing entire agreement portfolios in one call.
Simple Solutions:

Chunk large contracts:
def _split_large_contract(contract_text: str, max_tokens: int = 60000) -> List[str]:
    # Split by sections/clauses if too long
    words = contract_text.split()
    return [' '.join(words[i:i+max_tokens]) for i in range(0, len(words), max_tokens)]

Stream responses (already in your code):
response = self.client.chat.completions.create(**request_params, stream=True)

Recommendation: Add a warning if contract exceeds 50K tokens:

if len(contract_text.split()) > 50000:  # ~50K tokens
    logger.warning(f"Large contract ({len(contract_text.split())} words). Consider splitting.")

5. Customization
Smart to postpone. When needed, the _get_step_prompt() method is where you’d add industry-specific logic.

Summary of Recommendations:
Try parallel processing with max_workers=2 (adds ~10 lines of code).
Skip error recovery unless you see frequent API timeouts.
No changes needed for progress tracking (your existing UI handles it).
Add large contract warning (2 lines of code).
Postpone customization until needed.
All suggestions keep the code simple while addressing potential issues. Would you like me to proceed with the next method (_analyze_step)?
