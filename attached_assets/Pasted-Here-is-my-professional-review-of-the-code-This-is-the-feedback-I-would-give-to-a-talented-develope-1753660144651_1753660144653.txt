Here is my professional review of the code. This is the feedback I would give to a talented developer on my team to help them ship a truly robust, maintainable, and cost-effective product.

Overall Assessment: Excellent Implementation of the Core Architecture (A-)
The developer has successfully implemented the most critical part of the new architecture: the step-by-step analysis chain. The use of separate prompts, the main analysis loop, and the final assembly step is all correct. The code is clean and shows a strong grasp of the new requirements.

However, a few significant issues and missed opportunities prevent this from being "production-ready." My feedback will focus on robustness, maintainability, and operational efficiency.

Pushback #1: The Data Model is Disconnected (Critical Priority)
This is the most significant problem. The system performs a detailed step-by-step analysis but then fails to correctly populate the final data object that the UI depends on.

The Problem: The ASC606Analyzer loop correctly generates detailed JSON for each step and stores it in step_results. However, in the final return statement, it creates an ASC606Analysis object where the detailed fields like step1_contract_identification, step2_performance_obligations, etc., are not populated. They are left as None, and the __post_init__ in the models.py file simply turns them into empty dictionaries. The UI, which likely uses these fields to populate the expander sections, will show nothing. The professional_memo field is also not being populated, but rather a different field called five_step_analysis.

The Impact: This will break the results page UI. All the great, detailed analysis is being generated but then effectively thrown away instead of being structured for display.

The Fix: The final construction of the ASC606Analysis object must be changed to correctly map the results.

# In asc606_analyzer.py, at the end of analyze_contract

# --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
analysis_result = ASC606Analysis(
    # The final memo goes into the field the UI is expecting
    professional_memo=final_memo, 

    # Populate the summary fields from the detailed step results
    step1_contract_identification=step_results.get("step_1", {}),
    step2_performance_obligations=step_results.get("step_2", {}),
    step3_transaction_price=step_results.get("step_3", {}),
    step4_price_allocation=step_results.get("step_4", {}),
    step5_revenue_recognition=step_results.get("step_5", {}),

    # Keep the new detailed storage for debugging/future use
    step_by_step_details=step_results,

    # Populate other metadata correctly
    source_quality="Hybrid RAG - Step Analysis" if retrieved_context else "General Knowledge - Step Analysis",
    relevant_chunks=len(retrieved_context.split('\n\n')) if retrieved_context else 0,
    analysis_timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat()

    # Remove five_step_analysis if professional_memo is the correct field
)
# --- END OF FIX ---

Pushback #2: Codebase Hygiene and Legacy Artifacts (High Priority)
A production-ready codebase must be clean and free of confusing, unused code.

The Problem:
The asc606_analyzer.py file still contains the old _parse_analysis_response method. This method is now dead code; it's never called by the new analyze_contract function.
The prompt.py file still contains the old, monolithic get_analysis_prompt and its helpers. This is also legacy code that is no longer used by the new architecture.
The Impact: This creates "technical debt." A new developer (or the same developer in 6 months) will look at the code and be confused about which parsing logic or prompt is actually being used. It increases the risk of bugs and makes maintenance harder.
The Fix:
Delete the entire _parse_analysis_response method from asc606_analyzer.py.
Delete the get_analysis_prompt method and its private helpers (_load_expert_guidance, _get_memo_format, etc.) from prompt.py. The new StepAnalysisPrompts has replaced them.
Opportunity #1: Enhance RAG with Step-Specific Context
The current RAG implementation is good, but we can make it more precise and effective.

The Opportunity: Right now, the RAG system performs one single, "comprehensive" search at the beginning. However, the information needed for Step 2 (Performance Obligations) is very different from the information needed for Step 3 (Transaction Price).
The Impact: A single generic search might miss highly relevant but niche guidance for a specific step.
The Enhancement: Instead of one RAG call at the beginning, move the RAG call inside the for step_num in range(1, 6): loop. For each step, perform a new, targeted RAG search using keywords specific to that step (e.g., query for "distinct," "series," "separately identifiable" for Step 2). This will provide a much more relevant rag_context to each step-specific prompt, improving the quality of the analysis.
Opportunity #2: Model and Token Cost Optimization
The current model selection is powerful but expensive. We can be smarter about it.

The Opportunity: The developer has allocated 3000 tokens for each analysis step and 6000 for the final memo generation, all using the most powerful model (gpt-4o).
The Impact: This will work, but it will be very expensive, especially at scale. The total token count for one analysis could be (5 * 3000) + 6000 = 21,000 tokens.
The Enhancement:
Analysis vs. Assembly: The five analysis steps require the most powerful model (gpt-4o) because they involve complex reasoning. However, the final get_final_memo_generation_prompt is just assembling and formatting pre-existing text. It does not require complex reasoning.
Recommendation: Use a cheaper, faster model like gpt-4o-mini for the final memo assembly step. This could cut the cost of the most expensive part of the process by a significant margin without sacrificing quality, as the "thinking" has already been done.
Summary of Feedback for Your Developer
"This is a fantastic implementation of the new step-by-step architecture. The core logic is exactly what we discussed. Before we ship this, I've identified a few key refinements to ensure it's fully production-ready.

Critical: Connect the Data to the UI. The detailed step analysis isn't being mapped to the final ASC606Analysis object that the UI uses. We need to populate the stepX_... and professional_memo fields from our new step_results and final_memo variables.

Code Cleanup. Let's remove the old, unused _parse_analysis_response method and the legacy get_analysis_prompt from the codebase to eliminate confusion and technical debt.

Opportunity: Step-Specific RAG. To make the analysis even better, let's consider moving the RAG query inside the 5-step loop to provide more targeted guidance to each prompt.

Opportunity: Cost Optimization. For the final memo assembly, could we use a faster, cheaper model like gpt-4o-mini? Since that step is just formatting, not heavy analysis, it seems like a great way to manage our operational costs.

Once we address points 1 and 2, I believe this is ready to go. Points 3 and 4 are great topics for our next round of enhancements. Amazing progress here!"
