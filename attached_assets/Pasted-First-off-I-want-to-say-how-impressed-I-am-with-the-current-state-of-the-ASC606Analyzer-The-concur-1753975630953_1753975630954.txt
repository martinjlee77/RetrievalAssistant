First off, I want to say how impressed I am with the current state of the ASC606Analyzer. The concurrent processing is incredibly fast, and the structured, deterministic way it generates the analysis steps is robust and reliable. Itâ€™s a fantastic piece of engineering.

I'd like to propose a discussion around an enhancement that I believe is the next logical step in elevating our product's output quality. This change focuses on the final presentation of the detailed analysis within each of the five ASC 606 steps, moving from a sectioned data-dump to a more professional, narrative-driven format.

My goal is to share my thinking, provide a concrete example of the desired output, and propose a potential implementation path for us to discuss.

Part 1: The "Why" - Current State vs. Desired State
Currently, the format_step_detail_as_markdown function takes the four distinct fields from the LLM's JSON response (executive_conclusion, supporting_analysis, contract_evidence, key_considerations) and formats them with separate headings.

Current Output (Simplified "Before"):

### Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price

**Conclusion:**
[Conclusion text here...]

**Supporting Analysis:**
[Analysis text here, with ASC 606 citations...]

**Contract Evidence:**
['Quote 1 from contract...', 'Quote 2 from contract...']

**Key Considerations:**
[Text about judgments and other considerations...]

While this is structured and predictable, it feels a bit disjointed. It forces the reader to jump between sections to connect a point in the Supporting Analysis with its corresponding Contract Evidence.

My proposal is to evolve this into a more natural, narrative flow that mirrors how a human expert would write a technical memo. The key idea is to group the analysis thematically, with the supporting evidence (citations and quotes) presented immediately after the point it supports.

Proposed Output (Conceptual "After"):

### Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price

**Conclusion:**
[The same, clear, upfront conclusion text here...]

---

**Detailed Analysis:**

The determination of the transaction price is governed by ASC 606-10-32-2... Our analysis focused on two key areas:

**1. Identification of Fixed Consideration**
The arrangement involves a fixed monthly fee. The contract documentation confirms this explicitly:

> `[Relevant quote from the contract proving the fixed fee]`

**2. Assessment for Other Considerations**
A critical part of the analysis is evaluating the contract for complex elements. Our review concluded that a significant financing component is not present, as per ASC 606-10-32-15, due to the monthly billing cycle.

This narrative approach is more readable, persuasive, and professional. To be clear, the overall 5-step structure and the upfront Conclusion for each step should absolutely remain. This change only applies to the body of the analysis within each step.

Part 2: The "How" - A Proposed Implementation Path
To achieve this, we need to change both the prompt we send to the LLM and the Python function that formats the response. My proposed path is to refactor the prompt to ask for a more complex, nested JSON structure that is already organized thematically.

This is more efficient than adding a second "weaver" LLM call and gives us more control over the output.

Here are the specific, production-ready code changes I'm proposing for our discussion.

Step 1: Update the Prompt in StepPrompts.py
We would replace the current get_step_specific_analysis_prompt with a new version that asks the LLM to do the thematic grouping for us.

File: step_prompts.py Proposed New Prompt Function:

# In class StepPrompts:

@staticmethod
def get_step_specific_analysis_prompt(step_number: int, step_title: str, step_guidance: str,
                                    contract_text: str, rag_context: str,
                                    contract_data=None, debug_config=None) -> str:
    """
    Generate a step-specific analysis prompt that requests a NARRATIVE, thematically-grouped JSON output.
    """
    return f"""You are an expert technical accountant specializing in ASC 606. Your task is to analyze a contract for Step {step_number}: {step_title}.

PRIMARY GUIDANCE FOR THIS STEP: {step_guidance}

AUTHORITATIVE & INDUSTRY GUIDANCE CONTEXT:
{rag_context}

CONTRACT TEXT TO ANALYZE:
{contract_text}

CONTRACT DATA:
Customer: {getattr(contract_data, 'customer_name', 'N/A') if contract_data else 'N/A'}
Analysis Focus: {getattr(contract_data, 'key_focus_areas', 'General ASC 606 compliance') if contract_data else 'General ASC 606 compliance'}

*** YOUR CRITICAL TASK ***
Analyze the contract and structure your findings thematically. For each distinct topic or issue you identify for this step, provide your analysis, the supporting ASC 606 rule, and the direct contract evidence.

You MUST return your response as a single, well-formed JSON object with the following exact structure:
{{
  "executive_conclusion": "A clear, one-to-three sentence conclusion for this entire step. This is the 'bottom line'.",
  "analysis_points": [
    {{
      "topic_title": "The name of the first major theme or issue you analyzed (e.g., 'Identification of Fixed Consideration').",
      "analysis_text": "Your detailed analysis for THIS TOPIC ONLY. Explain the issue, apply the ASC 606 guidance (citing specific paragraphs like ASC 606-10-XX-XX), and introduce the contract evidence.",
      "evidence_quotes": [
        "A specific, direct quote from the contract that supports the analysis for this topic. You MUST include the source document name, formatted as: 'Quote text... (Source: [Document Name])'",
        "Another supporting quote, if applicable."
      ]
    }},
    {{
      "topic_title": "The name of the second major theme or issue (e.g., 'Assessment of Variable Consideration').",
      "analysis_text": "Your detailed analysis for this second topic...",
      "evidence_quotes": [
        "A quote supporting the second topic... (Source: [Document Name])"
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Ensure every single quote in `evidence_quotes` includes the source document name. Do not create a separate 'key_considerations' field; instead, weave those points directly into the `analysis_text` for the relevant topic.
"""

Step 2: Create a New Formatting Function in StepPrompts.py
This new function will know how to parse the new JSON structure from the prompt above and format it into our desired narrative markdown.

File: step_prompts.py Proposed New Formatting Function:

# In class StepPrompts:

@staticmethod
def format_step_detail_as_markdown_narrative(step_data: dict, step_number: int, step_name: str) -> str:
    """Formats the step analysis from a narrative JSON structure into professional markdown."""
    if not step_data or not isinstance(step_data, dict):
        return f"### Step {step_number}: {step_name}\n\nNo analysis data was returned for this step.\n"

    conclusion = step_data.get('executive_conclusion', 'No conclusion was provided.')
    analysis_points = step_data.get('analysis_points', [])

    # Start with the main heading and the upfront conclusion
    markdown_sections = [
        f"### Step {step_number}: {step_name}",
        f"**Conclusion:**\n{conclusion}",
        "\n---\n", # Visual separator
        "**Detailed Analysis:**\n"
    ]

    if not analysis_points:
        markdown_sections.append("No detailed analysis points were provided.")
    else:
        # Loop through each thematically-grouped analysis point
        for i, point in enumerate(analysis_points):
            topic_title = point.get('topic_title', f'Analysis Point {i+1}')
            analysis_text = point.get('analysis_text', 'No analysis text provided.')
            evidence_quotes = point.get('evidence_quotes', [])

            # Add the topic as a sub-heading
            markdown_sections.append(f"**{i+1}. {topic_title}**")
            markdown_sections.append(analysis_text)

            # Add the evidence quotes for that topic
            if evidence_quotes:
                for quote in evidence_quotes:
                    # Format as a markdown blockquote for emphasis
                    markdown_sections.append(f"> {quote}")

            markdown_sections.append("") # Add a blank line for spacing before the next point

    return "\n".join(markdown_sections)

Step 3: Update the Main Workflow in ASC606Analyzer.py
Finally, we just need to call our new formatting function instead of the old one.

File: ASC606Analyzer.py Inside the analyze_contract method, in the "Generate Detailed Analysis" section:

# --- Current Code ---
# for i in range(1, 6):
#     step_data = step_results.get(f"step_{i}", {})
#     formatted_step = StepPrompts.format_step_detail_as_markdown(
#         step_data, i, step_names[i-1]
#     )
#     detailed_analysis_sections.append(formatted_step)

# --- Proposed Change ---
for i in range(1, 6):
    step_data = step_results.get(f"step_{i}", {})
    # Call the new narrative formatting function
    formatted_step = StepPrompts.format_step_detail_as_markdown_narrative(
        step_data, i, step_names[i-1]
    )
    detailed_analysis_sections.append(formatted_step)

Part 3: Discussion Points
This is my proposed path, but I'd love to get your expert opinion on it.

Feasibility: Do you see any risks with asking the LLM for this more complex, nested JSON structure? My hope is that by being very explicit in the prompt, we can achieve high reliability.
Alternative Paths: Would you prefer an alternative, like a two-step "weaver" approach where we get the data as-is and then use a second LLM call to format it into a narrative? It seems less efficient, but might be an option if the single-prompt approach proves unreliable.
Testing: What's the best way to test this? We should probably run a set of existing contracts through the new logic and compare the outputs side-by-side to ensure no key information is lost.
I'm really excited about this potential improvement. I think it could significantly enhance the perceived quality and value of our analysis.

Let me know what you think, and we can schedule some time to discuss it further.
