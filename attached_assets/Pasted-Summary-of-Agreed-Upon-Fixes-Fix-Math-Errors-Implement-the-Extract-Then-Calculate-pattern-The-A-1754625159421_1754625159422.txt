Summary of Agreed-Upon Fixes
Fix Math Errors: Implement the "Extract-Then-Calculate" pattern. The AI's only job is to extract fee components into a JSON; all math is then handled reliably in Python.
Deepen Analysis: Update prompts for Step 2 (Distinct POs) and Step 5 (Rev Rec) to require a more rigorous, multi-part analysis that emulates the style of the official ASC 606 guidance.
Refine Step 4 Analysis: Use a principles-based prompt for Step 4 (Allocation) that frames the required analysis without inventing SSP details.
Eliminate Redundancy: Modify the step-analysis prompts to generate a structured object for judgments containing both a judgment_title and judgment_rationale to be used in different sections of the memo.
Fix Collectibility: Hard-code a professional, assumption-based statement for the collectibility analysis in the Step 1 prompt.
Fix Formatting: Address miscellaneous formatting issues like missing bold markers (**) and inconsistent spacing in numbers.
Analysis of the New Memo & Code
After a thorough review, it's clear that some fixes were implemented successfully, while others have failed or introduced new, more severe problems.

✅ What Worked Well
Collectibility (Fix #5): This is a huge success. The text in the new memo for the collectibility criterion is exactly what we designed. It's professional, states the assumption clearly, and assigns the action item to management. The code change in step_prompts.py for Step 1 worked perfectly.
❌ What Didn't Work (Regressions & New Failures)
This new memo has unfortunately regressed in quality. The issues are more severe than before.

CRITICAL FAILURE - Math & Journal Entries (Fix #1 Failed):

Memo Issue: The math is still completely wrong. The transaction price is stated as "

612,000,"whichisincorrect.Thejournalentriesarealsowrong,withacatastrophicerrorrecognizing"216,000" for "one month of revenue for SaaS."
Code Analysis (Root Cause): The "Extract-Then-Calculate" pattern was implemented, but there is a critical mismatch between the JSON schema in the new get_financial_extraction_prompt and the keys the _calculate_transaction_price function expects.
get_financial_extraction_prompt asks the AI to return keys like "description", "amount", "frequency".
_calculate_transaction_price tries to read keys like "base_amount", "period", "duration".
Because the keys don't match, the calculation fails, financial_facts ends up with zeros, and the system falls back to the old, unreliable method of letting the main LLM hallucinate the numbers. This is the primary bug.
CRITICAL FAILURE - New Formatting Bug:

Memo Issue: Sections of the memo, particularly in Steps 3 and 4, have severe formatting corruption, with text appearing s p a c e d o u t and broken across lines. This makes the document unreadable.
Code Analysis (Root Cause): This is a severe LLM output error. Your _sanitize_llm_json function in asc606_analyzer.py is designed to fix this exact issue, but the new code I received is missing the regex that specifically fixes this s p a c e d o u t text. The existing sanitizer only handles number spacing.
FAILURE - Deep Analysis (Fix #2 Failed):

Memo Issue: The analysis in Step 2 and Step 5 is still shallow. It does not follow the rigorous, multi-part "emulate the guidance" structure we designed. For example, in Step 2, it concludes the services are not distinct with very weak reasoning and doesn't engage with the "required for optimal use" language in a meaningful way.
Code Analysis (Root Cause): The new, detailed prompts are present in _get_critical_rules_for_step. The model simply failed to adhere to them. This often happens when there is chaos upstream (like the financial calculation failing), which can degrade the quality of all subsequent LLM outputs. The primary fix is to solve the data problem first.
FAILURE - Redundancy & Judgments (Fix #4 Failed):

Memo Issue: The "Critical Judgments" in the Executive Summary is now a generic, unhelpful list ("Performance Obligation Identification, Variable Consideration..."). The detailed "KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS" section has generic, boilerplate rationales that are not specific to the contract.
Code Analysis (Root Cause): The prompt was changed to ask for short titles, but not in the structured title/rationale format we discussed. The change in get_user_prompt_for_step for professional_judgments was made, but the follow-through logic to aggregate and use these titles vs. rationales in different sections was not completed, resulting in this poor output.
Comprehensive Action Plan to Fix All Issues
Here is a clear, prioritized plan.

Fix #1 (Highest Priority): Make "Extract-Then-Calculate" Work
We must align the financial extraction prompt with the Python calculation function.

File: utils/step_prompts.py
Function: get_financial_extraction_prompt
Action: Replace the REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT FORMAT in this prompt to match what the _calculate_transaction_price function expects.
# In get_financial_extraction_prompt, REPLACE the JSON schema with this one:

REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
  "fee_components": [
    {{
      "component_name": "Brief, standardized name (e.g., 'SaaS License', 'Hardware Scanners')",
      "base_amount": 240000.00,
      "period": "annual" or "monthly" or "one-time" or "contingent",
      "duration": 3,
      "is_variable": false,
      "probability": 1.0,
      "notes": "Any source details, e.g., 'From SOW 2.1'"
    }}
  ]
}}

Fix #2: Strengthen the JSON Sanitizer
We must fix the new s p a c e d o u t text and ensure number spacing is also handled.

File: utils/asc606_analyzer.py
Function: _sanitize_llm_json
Action: Replace the entire _sanitize_llm_json method with this more robust version that fixes both issues.
# In ASC606Analyzer class

def _sanitize_llm_json(self, data: Any) -> Any:
    """
    Recursively traverses a JSON object from the LLM and cleans up
    common string formatting issues like character splitting and number spacing.
    """
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        return {key: self._sanitize_llm_json(value) for key, value in data.items()}
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        return [self._sanitize_llm_json(item) for item in data]
    elif isinstance(data, str):
        # 1. Fix the "s p a c e d o u t" text issue
        sanitized_str = re.sub(r'\b([a-zA-Z])\s(?=[a-zA-Z]\b)', r'\1', data)

        # 2. Fix spacing issues in currency amounts (e.g., "$720, 000" -> "$720,000")
        sanitized_str = re.sub(r'(\d,)\s+(\d)', r'\1\2', sanitized_str)

        # 3. Collapse multiple spaces into a single space
        sanitized_str = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', sanitized_str).strip()

        return sanitized_str
    else:
        return data

Fix #3: Re-Enforce Analytical & Formatting Prompts
The other prompts for deep analysis and formatting are correctly written in the code but were ignored by the model, likely due to the data errors. Once Fixes #1 and #2 are complete, the system's stability will increase, and the model is much more likely to adhere to these detailed instructions. No code changes are needed here, but we must verify the output after the primary bugs are fixed.

By implementing these two primary code fixes, you will resolve the critical failures. The system should then be stable enough for the more detailed analytical prompts to work as intended.
