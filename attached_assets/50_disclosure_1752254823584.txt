50 Disclosure
General Note: The Disclosure Section provides guidance regarding the disclosure in the notes to financial statements. In some cases, disclosure may relate to disclosure on the face of the financial statements.
General
606-10-50-1
The objective of the disclosure requirements in this Topic is for an entity to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. To achieve that objective, an entity shall disclose qualitative and quantitative information about all of the following:
aIts contracts with customers (see paragraphs 606-10-50-4 through 50-16)
bThe significant judgments, and changes in the judgments, made in applying the guidance in this Topic to those contracts (see paragraphs 606-10-50-17 through 50-21)
cAny assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer in accordance with paragraph 340-40-25-1 or 340-40-25-5 (see paragraphs 340-40-50-1 through 50-6).
606-10-50-2
An entity shall consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective and how much emphasis to place on each of the various requirements. An entity shall aggregate or disaggregate disclosures so that useful information is not obscured by either the inclusion of a large amount of insignificant detail or the aggregation of items that have substantially different characteristics.
606-10-50-3
Amounts disclosed are for each reporting period for which a statement of comprehensive income (statement of activities) is presented and as of each reporting period for which a statement of financial position is presented. An entity need not disclose information in accordance with the guidance in this Topic if it has provided the information in accordance with another Topic.
> Contracts with Customers
606-10-50-4
An entity shall disclose all of the following amounts for the reporting period unless those amounts are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income (statement of activities) in accordance with other Topics:
aRevenue recognized from contracts with customers, which the entity shall disclose separately from its other sources of revenue
bCredit losses recorded (in accordance with Subtopic 326-20 on financial instruments measured at amortized cost) on any receivables or contract assets arising from an entity's contracts with customers, which the entity shall disclose separately from credit losses from other contracts.
路 > Disaggregation of Revenue
606-10-50-5
An entity shall disaggregate revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. An entity shall apply the guidance in paragraphs 606-10-55-89 through 55-91 when selecting the categories to use to disaggregate revenue.
606-10-50-6
In addition, an entity shall disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the relationship between the disclosure of disaggregated revenue (in accordance with paragraph 606-10-50-5) and revenue information that is disclosed for each reportable segment, if the entity applies Topic 280 on segment reporting.
606-10-50-7
An entity, except for a public business entity, a not-for-profit entity that has issued, or is a conduit bond obligor for, securities that are traded, listed, or quoted on an exchange or an over-the-counter market, or an employee benefit plan that files or furnishes financial statements with or to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), may elect not to apply the quantitative disaggregation disclosure guidance in paragraphs 606-10-50-5 through 50-6 and 606-10-55-89 through 55-91. If an entity elects not to provide those disclosures, the entity shall disclose, at a minimum, revenue disaggregated according to the timing of transfer of goods or services (for example, revenue from goods or services transferred to customers at a point in time and revenue from goods or services transferred to customers over time) and qualitative information about how economic factors (such as type of customer, geographical location of customers, and type of contract) affect the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows.
路 > Contract Balances
606-10-50-8
An entity shall disclose all of the following:
aThe opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities from contracts with customers, if not otherwise separately presented or disclosed

606-10-50-9
An entity shall explain how the timing of satisfaction of its performance obligations (see paragraph 606-10-50-12(a)) relates to the typical timing of payment (see paragraph 606-10-50-12(b)) and the effect that those factors have on the contract asset and the contract liability balances. The explanation provided may use qualitative information.
606-10-50-10
An entity shall provide an explanation of the significant changes in the contract asset and the contract liability balances during the reporting period. The explanation shall include qualitative and quantitative information. Examples of changes in the entity's balances of contract assets and contract liabilities include any of the following:
aChanges due to business combinations
bCumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue that affect the corresponding contract asset or contract liability, including adjustments arising from a change in the measure of progress, a change in an estimate of the transaction price (including any changes in the assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained), or a contract modification
cImpairment of a contract asset
dA change in the time frame for a right to consideration to become unconditional (that is, for a contract asset to be reclassified to a receivable)
eA change in the time frame for a performance obligation to be satisfied (that is, for the recognition of revenue arising from a contract liability).
606-10-50-11
An entity, except for a public business entity, a not-for-profit entity that has issued, or is a conduit bond obligor for, securities that are traded, listed, or quoted on an exchange or an over-the-counter market, or an employee benefit plan that files or furnishes financial statements with or to the SEC, may elect not to provide any or all of the disclosures in paragraphs 606-10-50-8 through 50-10 and 606-10-50-12A.

aWhen the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations (for example, upon shipment, upon delivery, as services are rendered, or upon completion of service) including when performance obligations are satisfied in a bill-and-hold arrangement
bThe significant payment terms (for example, when payment typically is due, whether the contract has a significant financing component, whether the consideration amount is variable, and whether the estimate of variable consideration is typically constrained in accordance with paragraphs 606-10-32-11 through 32-13)
cThe nature of the goods or services that the entity has promised to transfer, highlighting any performance obligations to arrange for another party to transfer goods or services (that is, if the entity is acting as an agent)

2By using qualitative information.
606-10-50-14
An entity need not disclose the information in paragraph 606-10-50-13 for a performance obligation if either of the following conditions is met:

An entity shall disclose which optional exemptions in paragraphs 606-10-50-14 through 50-14A it is applying. In addition, an entity applying the optional exemptions in paragraphs 606-10-50-14 through 50-14A shall disclose the nature of the performance obligations, the remaining duration (see paragraph 606-10-25-3), and a description of the variable consideration (for example, the nature of the variability and how that variability will be resolved) that has been excluded from the information disclosed in accordance with paragraph 606-10-50-13. This information shall include sufficient detail to enable users of financial statements to understand the remaining performance obligations that the entity excluded from the information disclosed in accordance with paragraph 606-10-50-13. In addition, an entity shall explain whether any consideration from contracts with customers is not included in the transaction price and, therefore, not included in the information disclosed in accordance with paragraph 606-10-50-13.
