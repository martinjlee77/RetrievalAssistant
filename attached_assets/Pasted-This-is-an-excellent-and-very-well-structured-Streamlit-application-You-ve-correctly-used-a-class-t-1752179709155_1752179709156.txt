This is an excellent and very well-structured Streamlit application. You've correctly used a class to organize logic, leveraged st.session_state for state management, and created a clean two-page flow (upload vs. results). The use of help text and placeholders is also top-notch.

Here are my recommendations for significant improvements, focusing on robustness, user experience (UX), and maintainability.

Summary of Key Changes
Critical Bug Fix: Your code has a NameError that will crash the app. I'll identify and fix it.
Introduce st.form: To prevent the app from re-running on every single widget change and to enable better input validation.
Improve UI with st.tabs: To organize the long input form, reducing cognitive load for the user.
Add Pydantic for Data Validation: To make your data handling much more robust, self-documenting, and less prone to errors.
Minor Code Refinements: To make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
Detailed Improvements (What to Change and Why)
Change 1: Critical Bug Fix (NameError)
What to Change: In your process_contract function, you save 'effective_date': effective_date.isoformat() to st.session_state. However, you never define the variable effective_date in your render_upload_interface. There is contract_start and contract_end, but no effective_date.
Why: This will cause a NameError and crash the application the moment a user clicks the "Analyze Contract" button. I will remove this line in the refactored code. You can add a new st.date_input for it if it's a required field.
Change 2: Use st.form for Input Collection
What to Change: Wrap all the input widgets (st.text_input, st.date_input, st.file_uploader, etc.) and the "Analyze Contract" button inside a with st.form(key='contract_form'): block. The button should be changed to st.form_submit_button().
Why:
Performance: Right now, every time a user types a character in a text box or selects a date, the entire Streamlit script re-runs. This can feel sluggish. A form batches all inputs together, and the app only re-runs when the user explicitly clicks the submit button.
Better Validation: This allows you to check all the required fields at once when the form is submitted, rather than having the app re-run and potentially lose state with each interaction.
Change 3: Organize the UI with st.tabs
What to Change: The render_upload_interface method has many inputs. I will group them into logical tabs: "1. Contract Details", "2. Upload Document", and "3. Analysis Options".
Why: This dramatically cleans up the user interface. Instead of a long, intimidating form to scroll through, the user is guided through a clear, step-by-step process. It makes the app feel more professional and less overwhelming.
Change 4: Introduce Pydantic for Data Structuring
What to Change: Instead of building a raw dictionary for st.session_state.contract_data, I will define a Pydantic BaseModel. This class will explicitly define each field, its data type, and default values.
Why:
Robustness & Validation: Pydantic automatically validates the inputs. If you try to assign a string to a date field, it will raise an error. This catches bugs before they happen.
Readability & Maintainability: The Pydantic model acts as self-documenting code. Anyone reading your script immediately understands the exact structure of the contract data.
IDE Support: You get excellent auto-completion and type-checking in editors like VS Code.
