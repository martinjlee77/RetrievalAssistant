1. Summary of performance obligations (from Step 2)
Based on the Master Agreement and Orders No. 1 and 2, the key promised goods and services (from the vendor to the Company) can be summarized as follows (subject to confirmation of Step 2 conclusions):

Professional / implementation services

Orders No. 1 and 2 each bundle many of these items into a single, integrated program (OTC/Flex/Wellness program in Order 1; Rewards & Incentives program in Order 2). Step 2 likely concluded that:

Implementation / professional services are distinct from ongoing hosted services (they are separately described and can be contracted on time‑and‑materials, fixed‑fee or not‑to‑exceed bases [Contract, “Professional Service Fees | Check one: Fixed Fee / Time and Material / Not‑to‑Exceed”]).
Ongoing hosted platform, card program, e‑commerce, and support form a combined performance obligation, because the customer receives a single integrated benefit (a functioning supplemental benefits/rewards card program) and the various activities (hosting, cards, catalogs, e‑commerce, claims handling, reporting) are highly interdependent.
Per‑unit items (cards, catalogs, claims, ACH, checks) are either (a) part of that integrated service (usage‑based consideration), or (b) distinct, per‑use performance obligations that are satisfied as each service is rendered.
Because the allocation in Step 4 depends on how Step 2 grouped or separated these promises, management must ensure that the final list of performance obligations from Step 2 is used as the allocation basis.
