Great question! Let me search for Stripe's official guidance on transitioning from test mode to live mode to give you the most accurate and up-to-date information.


Searched the web for "Stripe transition from test mode to live production mode checklist 2025"

Decided on live mode transition guide
Excellent question! Based on Stripe's official documentation, here's your complete guide to going live:

Steps to Convert from Test to Live Mode
1. Activate Your Stripe Account (First!)
Go to your Stripe Dashboard and complete account activation
Provide business information, KYC details, and banking info
You can accept live payments immediately after activation completes
2. Get Your Live API Keys
Navigate to Developers ‚Üí API keys in Stripe Dashboard
You'll see your live keys: sk_live_... (secret) and pk_live_... (publishable)
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Live secret keys are shown ONLY ONCE at creation - copy them immediately!
3. Update Your Backend Environment Variables
Replace your test keys with live keys in your environment:

Current (Test):

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
Production (Live):

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
4. Configure Live Webhooks ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
Your test webhooks won't work in live mode!

Go to Developers ‚Üí Webhooks in Stripe Dashboard
Add new endpoint for live mode: https://veritaslogic.ai/api/stripe/webhook
Select the same events you're using in test mode: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed
Copy the live webhook secret (starts with whsec_...)
Update your environment: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
5. Recreate Products in Live Mode üîÑ
Important: Test and live modes are completely separate!

Objects that DON'T transfer:

Products
Prices
Customers
Subscriptions
You need to recreate your credit packages in live mode (currently you have $500/$1000/$2000 packages).

Can You Trust Sandbox ‚Üí Production?
‚úÖ What Will Work
Payment processing logic
Webhook handling
API integration code
Error handling
User flows
‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Verification
Webhook endpoints - Must be HTTPS with valid TLS certificate
Product IDs - Recreate with identical IDs/structure in live mode
3D Secure flows - Test with real cards (some banks behave differently)
Statement descriptors - Verify how your business name appears on customer statements
Testing Strategy for Live Mode
DO NOT use real cards for testing in production! Stripe flags this as suspicious activity.

Instead:

Monitor first real transactions closely
Use small amounts initially (if needed, refund immediately)
Check webhook delivery in live Dashboard
Review error logs for any new edge cases
Verify email notifications are working (you just set these up!)
Your Pre-Launch Checklist
Before switching to live:

‚úÖ 1. Rotate API keys - Generate fresh live keys (in case test keys were exposed)
‚úÖ 2. Activate Stripe account - Complete business verification
‚úÖ 3. Set up live webhooks - Different endpoint secret required
‚úÖ 4. Recreate products - $500/$1000/$2000 credit packages in live mode
‚úÖ 5. Update environment variables - Switch to sk_live_... keys
‚úÖ 6. Test webhook delivery - Send test event from Stripe Dashboard
‚úÖ 7. Enable 2FA - Secure your Stripe account
‚úÖ 8. Configure statement descriptor - So customers recognize charges

Deployment Day
Update Railway environment variables with live keys
Deploy updated environment
Test one small real transaction ($5 credit purchase?)
Monitor Stripe Dashboard for successful webhook delivery
Check your new email notification system is working!
Post-Launch Monitoring
Watch these for the first few days:

Webhook success rates in Stripe Dashboard
Payment success/failure email alerts (you just built this!)
Any error spikes in Railway logs
Customer disputes/chargebacks
Bottom line: If it works well in sandbox, it will work in production - BUT you need to recreate products, configure live webhooks, and update API keys. The code itself is solid, just environmental configuration changes needed!

Would you like help with any specific step, like recreating your credit packages in live mode or updating the Railway environment variables?
