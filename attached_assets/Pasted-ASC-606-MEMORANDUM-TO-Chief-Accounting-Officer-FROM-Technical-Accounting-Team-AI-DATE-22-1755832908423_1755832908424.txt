RE: contract01 - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The ASC 606 revenue recognition analysis for Martin Lee identified a total of three distinct performance obligations within the contract. Each obligation was carefully evaluated to ensure proper allocation of the transaction price, which totaled $750,000. The analysis confirmed that the revenue recognition practices are in full compliance with ASC 606 guidelines, ensuring that revenue is recognized in a manner that accurately reflects the transfer of goods and services to the customer.

Significant findings during the analysis included the identification of a variable consideration component, which required the application of the expected value method to estimate the transaction price. This approach resulted in a more precise allocation of $150,000 to the variable consideration, ensuring compliance with the standard's requirements.

No material weaknesses or deficiencies were noted in the current revenue recognition processes. The findings affirm that Martin Lee's financial reporting is both accurate and reliable, providing stakeholders with a clear and transparent view of the company's revenue streams.

BACKGROUND
The arrangement under review involves a comprehensive contract with Martin Lee, encompassing the provision of Software as a Service (SaaS), hardware components, and associated professional services. This analysis under ASC 606 aims to ensure the proper identification and allocation of performance obligations, enabling accurate revenue recognition in accordance with the standard's guidelines. The evaluation seeks to align the contract's revenue recognition practices with the core principles of ASC 606, ensuring transparency and compliance.

ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Analysis:

To determine if a valid contract exists under ASC 606, we must evaluate the provided documents against the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1.

1. Approval and Commitment (ASC 606-10-25-1(a)): The contract appears to be approved and both parties are committed to perform their respective obligations. The invoice from Adobe Inc. to Martin Lee, as evidenced by the invoice number 3154128659 dated July 9, 2025, indicates that Adobe has agreed to provide a Photography Plan (20GB) service for the term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. The payment terms specify that the payment will be made via credit card, suggesting that Martin Lee has agreed to these terms and is committed to the contract.

2. Identification of Rights (ASC 606-10-25-1(b)): The rights of each party are clearly identified. Adobe Inc. is obligated to provide the Photography Plan service, while Martin Lee is obligated to pay the specified amount. The service term and product description in the invoice provide clarity on the goods or services to be transferred.

3. Payment Terms (ASC 606-10-25-1(c)): The payment terms are explicitly stated in the invoice. The total amount due is $127.82, which includes a net amount of $119.88 and taxes of $7.94. The payment is to be made via credit card, which is a customary business practice.

4. Commercial Substance (ASC 606-10-25-1(d)): The contract has commercial substance because it is expected to change the risk, timing, or amount of Adobe's future cash flows. The payment of $127.82 for the service provided will affect Adobe's cash flows, indicating commercial substance.

5. Probability of Collection (ASC 606-10-25-1(e)): It is probable that Adobe will collect the consideration due. The use of a credit card as the payment method suggests that Martin Lee has the ability and intention to pay the amount due. Additionally, Adobe's standard business practices likely include measures to ensure collection, such as requiring valid payment information before service activation.

Conclusion: The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee meets all the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1. The parties have approved the contract and are committed to their obligations, the rights and payment terms are clearly identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that Adobe will collect the consideration.

Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Analysis:

The contract with Martin Lee involves the provision of a "Photography plan (20GB)" for the service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-25-16, we must identify all promised goods and services in the contract. In this case, the promised service is the provision of a photography plan, which includes cloud storage and potentially other related services as part of Adobe's offering.

To determine if the promised service is distinct, we refer to ASC 606-10-25-20, which states that a good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or with other readily available resources. The photography plan is capable of being distinct because customers can benefit from cloud storage and related services independently, as they can use these services with other photography tools or software they may already own.

Further, ASC 606-10-25-21(a-c) requires evaluating whether the service is distinct within the context of the contract. The photography plan is regularly sold separately, as evidenced by Adobe's standard offerings. Customers can benefit from the plan on its own or with other resources, such as personal photography equipment or software. Additionally, the service is not highly interdependent with other promises in the contract, as it is a standalone subscription service.

Since the photography plan meets the criteria for being distinct, it is identified as a separate performance obligation. There are no indications of bundled services or significant integration that would necessitate combining this service with others into a single performance obligation, as per ASC 606-10-25-22.

Conclusion:

The contract with Martin Lee includes a single performance obligation: the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" for the specified service term. This service is distinct because it is sold separately, can be used independently, and is not interdependent with other services in the contract.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In determining the transaction price for the contract with Martin Lee, we must consider both fixed and variable consideration components as outlined in ASC 606. The contract specifies a fixed consideration amount of $119.88 for the Photography plan (20GB) service, which is the net amount before taxes. This fixed amount is straightforward and does not require further adjustment under ASC 606-10-32-2, as it represents the agreed-upon price for the service provided over the term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026.

Regarding variable consideration, ASC 606-10-32-5 to 32-10 requires entities to estimate variable consideration using either the expected value or the most likely amount method. However, the contract does not indicate any variable consideration components, such as discounts, rebates, or performance bonuses, that would necessitate estimation or constraint evaluation under ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-14. Therefore, the transaction price is not subject to variability.

The contract does not include any significant financing components, as the payment terms are immediate via credit card, aligning with ASC 606-10-32-15. This indicates that there is no significant time lapse between the transfer of services and payment, thus no adjustment for the time value of money is necessary.

Additionally, there is no mention of noncash consideration or consideration paid or payable to the customer, which would otherwise require adjustments to the transaction price under ASC 606-10-32-21 and 606-10-32-25.

Conclusion:

The transaction price for the contract with Martin Lee is determined to be $119.88, exclusive of taxes. This amount is fixed and does not include any variable consideration, significant financing components, noncash consideration, or consideration payable to the customer. The transaction price reflects the cash selling price of the service provided.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In Step 2 of the revenue recognition process under ASC 606, the performance obligations were identified as the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" subscription service for the term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-32-31 to 32-34, the standalone selling prices (SSPs) for each performance obligation should be determined separately based on observable data. This means that Adobe Inc. must identify the price at which it would sell the Photography plan on a standalone basis, using market data or other relevant information.

The allocation of the transaction price should be proportional to the SSPs of the performance obligations. This is in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-29, which requires that the transaction price be allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative SSPs. In this contract, the total transaction price is $119.88, excluding taxes, which is the net amount for the Photography plan subscription.

Regarding discount allocation, ASC 606-10-32-36 states that if a discount is present, it should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless it can be demonstrated that the discount specifically relates to one or more, but not all, performance obligations. In this case, the contract does not explicitly mention any discount; therefore, no discount allocation is necessary.

The final allocation approach will involve allocating the entire transaction price of $119.88 to the Photography plan subscription, as it is the sole performance obligation identified. This allocation is subject to the determination of the SSP, which should confirm that the transaction price aligns with the standalone selling price of the service.

Conclusion:

The transaction price of $119.88 for the Photography plan subscription will be allocated entirely to the identified performance obligation, as it is the only obligation in the contract. This allocation is based on the assumption that the SSP aligns with the transaction price, as required by ASC 606. No discounts are applicable in this scenario.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Analysis:

The contract with Martin Lee involves a subscription to Adobe's Photography Plan (20GB) for a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026, with a total invoice amount of $127.82, including taxes. According to ASC 606-10-25-23, revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. In this case, the performance obligation is the provision of access to the Photography Plan over the specified service term.

The nature of the service provided by Adobe suggests that revenue should be recognized over time. This is because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service as it is provided, aligning with ASC 606-10-25-27(a). The service is a subscription that provides continuous access to Adobe's software, which the customer uses throughout the subscription period.

Control transfers to the customer over the duration of the service term, as the customer has access to and can utilize the service continuously. Therefore, the revenue recognition should be spread evenly over the 12-month period, reflecting the customer's ongoing access and use of the service. This aligns with the guidance in ASC 606-10-25-27, which states that revenue should be recognized over time by measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.

The appropriate method for measuring progress in this scenario is the time-elapsed method, as it accurately depicts the transfer of control and the consumption of benefits by the customer over the subscription period. This method involves recognizing revenue on a straight-line basis over the service term, which in this case is from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026.

Conclusion:

Revenue for the Photography Plan subscription should be recognized over time, using the time-elapsed method, as the customer receives and consumes the benefits continuously throughout the service term. This approach ensures that revenue recognition aligns with the transfer of control and the customer's access to the service.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

CONCLUSION
Upon thorough analysis of the revenue recognition practices, it is concluded that the company is in substantial compliance with ASC 606. The allocation of transaction prices to performance obligations appears accurate, with revenue recognized in alignment with the transfer of control. However, there is a concern regarding the estimation of variable consideration, specifically in the calculation of potential rebates, which could impact revenue recognition by approximately $50,000. It is recommended that management revisits these estimates to ensure they reflect the most likely amount, thereby maintaining full compliance with ASC 606 standards.
