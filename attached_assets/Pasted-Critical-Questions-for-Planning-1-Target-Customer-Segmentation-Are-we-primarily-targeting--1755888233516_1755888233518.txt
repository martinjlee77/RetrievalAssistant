Critical Questions for Planning:

1. **Target Customer Segmentation**

- Are we primarily targeting individual CPAs/controllers, mid-size firms, or Big 4 competitors? INDIVIDUAL CPAS AND CONTROLLERS AT CORPORATE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENTS.
- Should we focus on specific industries initially (tech startups, manufacturing, etc.) or remain broad? REMAIN BROAD
- What's the decision-making process - is it the technical accountant or the partner/CFO who buys? TECHNICAL ACCOUNTANTS FOR NOW AS WE'RE IN AN ADOPTION PHASE, WILL BE CFO AFTER THAT.

2. **Value Proposition Precision**

- Harvey.ai positions as "legal AI" broadly - should we be "accounting AI" or more specific like "revenue recognition AI"? ACCOUNTING AI -  WE'LL BE ADDING LEASES, CONTRACT COSTS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES, MANY MORE.
- How do we differentiate from generic AI tools that accountants might already be experimenting with? THIS IS DOMAIN SPECIFIC WITH FASB/RAG COMBINATION, I HAVE 20+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND USED THAT EXPERIENCE TO BUILD THIS TOOL
- What's our strongest competitive advantage - the 20+ year EY experience, the RAG system, or the audit-ready output quality? FIRST TWO FOR SURE.

3. **Pricing Strategy**

- Harvey.ai uses enterprise sales model - are we thinking per-user SaaS, per-analysis pricing, or enterprise deals? PER ANALYSIS PRICING WITH HUMAN IN THE LOOP REVIEW SERVICES OF THE AI GENERATED OUTPUT.
- Should we start with freemium to build adoption or premium positioning from day one? PREMIUM POSITIONING BUT I'M OPEN TO OFFERING TRIAL (TO BE EXACT, TRIAL CREDITS AS WE'LL BE ON A CONSUMPTION BASED MODEL)
- What's the economic value we're delivering - time savings, risk reduction, or both? PRIMARILY TIME AND COST SAVINGS. THEN RISK REDUCTION/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.

Strategic Reactions & Recommendations:

**Strengths in Your Plan:** AGREE

- Harvey.ai inspiration is spot-on - clean, professional, credible
- Domain-specific positioning is smart (vs generic AI)
- Founder credibility story is powerful differentiator
- Human-in-the-loop acknowledges professional skepticism

**Areas to Strengthen:** AGREE

1. **Demo Strategy**: Need working product demos, not just screenshots
2. **Trust Building**: Consider case studies, Big 4 endorsements, or pilot results
3. **Technical Credibility**: How do we explain RAG/FASB integration without being too technical?

**Critical Success Factors:** AGREE

- The first impression must scream "built by accountants for accountants"
- Need to address AI anxiety in conservative accounting profession
- Must demonstrate measurable ROI/time savings

Key Strategic Questions:

1. What's our go-to-market strategy - direct sales, partnerships with firms, or self-serve? DIRECT SALES VIA EMAIL AND SELF-SERVE
2. How do we handle the compliance/liability concerns that will come up? CAVEAT THE HECK OUT. PEOPLE CANNOT BLINDLY RELY ON AI GENERATED ANALYSIS. THEY NEED TO REVIEW AND I WILL ALSO PROVIDE REVIEW SERVICES. ARE YOU WORRIED THAT I'LL GET SUED?
3. Should we showcase the current ASC 606 system as proof-of-concept or wait until we have multiple standards? LET'S WAIT FOR NOW.
