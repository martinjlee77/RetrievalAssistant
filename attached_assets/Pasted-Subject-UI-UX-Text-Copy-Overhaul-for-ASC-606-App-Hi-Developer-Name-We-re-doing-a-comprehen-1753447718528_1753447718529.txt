Subject: UI/UX Text & Copy Overhaul for ASC 606 App
Hi [Developer Name],

We're doing a comprehensive update to all user-facing text in the asc606.py file to improve clarity, professionalism, and user experience. This involves changes to titles, tab names, labels, and help text.

Please implement the following changes. I've organized them by section for clarity.

1. Main Title & Subtitle
At the top of the app, please update the main st.title and the instructional st.write that follows.

Current Code:

st.title("ASC 606 Contract Analysis")
st.write(
    "Contract analysis using authoritative FASB guidance and industry leading interpretations. Complete the **required fields(*)** then click Analyze Contract."
)

New Code:

st.title("ASC 606: Revenue Contract Analysis")
st.write(
    "**Powered by Authoritative FASB Codification & Industry Interpretive Guidance.**\n\n"
    "An intelligent platform to generate comprehensive ASC 606 memos. Follow the numbered tabs to input contract details, provide context, and configure your analysis."
)

2. Tab Names
Update the tab names to remove the "Step" language and use circled numbers for ordering.

Current Code:

tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs([
    "**üìã Step 1: Upload Contract**",
    "**üìù Step 2: Analysis Questions**",
    "**‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Analyze**"
])

New Code:

tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs([
    "**‚ë† Contract & Documents**",
    "**‚ë° Key Considerations**",
    "**‚ë¢ Configure & Run**"
])

3. Tab 1: "‚ë† Contract & Documents"
Please make the following changes to the widgets and info messages within Tab 1.

a) Make arrangement_description optional and update its text.

Remove the * from the label.
Update the label, placeholder, and help text.
Important: You will also need to remove this field from the validate_form() function in Tab 3 (see section 5 below).
Current Code for arrangement_description:

arrangement_description = st.text_area(
    "Arrangement Description *",
    placeholder="e.g., Three-year SaaS subscription with implementation services",
    height=100,
    help="Description of the contractual arrangement - more detail is better to provide context for the AI"
)

New Code for arrangement_description:

arrangement_description = st.text_area(
    "Overall Arrangement Summary (Optional)",
    placeholder='e.g., "New 3-year SaaS license with one-time setup fee."',
    height=100,
    help="Provide a one-sentence summary of the deal. This gives the AI crucial high-level context before it analyzes the details."
)

b) Add help text to other input fields.

For customer_name: Add help="The legal entity name of the customer as it appears on the contract."
For contract_start: Add help="The effective start date of the contractual period being analyzed."
For contract_end: Add help="The effective end date of the contractual period being analyzed."
c) Update the info message at the bottom of the tab.

Current Code:

st.info(
    "Once the fields above are complete, continue to the **üìù Step 2: Analysis Questions** tab.",
    icon="‚û°Ô∏è")

New Code:

st.info(
    "Once the fields above are complete, continue to the **‚ë° Key Considerations** tab.",
    icon="‚û°Ô∏è")

4. Tab 2: "‚ë° Key Considerations"
Please update the instructional text and add help text to the toggles.

a) Update the main instructional text.

Current Code:

st.write("Your answers provide crucial context for the AI analysis.")

New Code:

st.write("Your answers address key areas of judgment and provide crucial context for the AI.")

b) Add help text to the toggles.

For is_modification: Add help="Select if this is an amendment, addendum, or change order that modifies an existing contract."
For is_combined_contract: Add help="Per ASC 606-10-25-9, contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer should be combined if certain criteria are met. Select if these documents should be treated as a single accounting contract."
For principal_agent_involved: Add help="Select if another party is involved in providing the goods or services to your end customer (e.g., you are reselling another company's product)."
c) Update the info message at the bottom of the tab.

Current Code:

st.info("Continue to the **‚öôÔ∏è 3. Analyze** tab.", icon="‚û°Ô∏è")

New Code:

st.info("Continue to the **‚ë¢ Configure & Run** tab.", icon="‚û°Ô∏è")

5. Tab 3: "‚ë¢ Configure & Run"
Please update the headers and field labels.

a) Update the subheader and instructional text.

Current Code:

st.subheader("‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Steer the Analysis")
st.write(
    "The output will always be a comprehensive professional memo. Use these optional settings to guide the AI's focus and tailor the final report to your specific needs."
)

New Code:

st.subheader("‚öôÔ∏è Configure & Run Analysis")
st.write(
    "Finalize your analysis by providing optional focus areas and audience preferences before generating the memo."
)

b) Update the labels for the input fields. Remove the numbers from the labels.

"1. Key Questions or Areas of Focus (Optional)" ‚Üí "Key Focus Areas / Specific Questions (Optional)"
"2. Tailor Memo for Audience (Optional)" ‚Üí "Tailor Memo for Audience (Optional)"
"3. Materiality Threshold (in contract currency, Optional)" ‚Üí "Materiality Threshold (Optional)"
c) Remove arrangement_description from the validation function. This is a critical step to make the field optional.

Current validate_form() function:

def validate_form():
    """Validate required fields from Tab 1"""
    errors = []
    if not analysis_title: errors.append("Analysis Title is required (Tab 1).")
    if not customer_name: errors.append("Customer Name is required (Tab 1).")
    if not arrangement_description: errors.append("Arrangement Description is required (Tab 1).") # <-- REMOVE THIS LINE
    if not contract_types: errors.append("At least one Document Type must be selected (Tab 1).")
    if not uploaded_files: errors.append("At least one document must be uploaded (Tab 1).")
    return errors

New validate_form() function:

def validate_form():
    """Validate required fields from Tab 1"""
    errors = []
    if not analysis_title: errors.append("Analysis Title is required (Tab 1).")
    if not customer_name: errors.append("Customer Name is required (Tab 1).")
    # arrangement_description is now optional
    if not contract_types: errors.append("At least one Document Type must be selected (Tab 1).")
    if not uploaded_files: errors.append("At least one document must be uploaded (Tab 1).")
    return errors

That covers all the changes. Let me know if you have any questions!
