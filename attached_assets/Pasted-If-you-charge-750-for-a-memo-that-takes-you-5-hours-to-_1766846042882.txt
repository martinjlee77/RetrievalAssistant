If you charge $750 for a memo that takes you 5 hours to untangle, you are effectively working for $150/hour—which is far below your value as a VP/Partner.
However, you need a specific number on the website to anchor expectations and signal "This is affordable," unlike Big 4 consulting which signals "This starts at $10k."
Here is the "Tiered Productized Service" model I recommend for your pivot:
1. The "Starting At" Strategy
On the website, change the pricing to "From $750 per memo."
This filters out the cheap clients who want a $50 solution, but doesn't scare away the Controller who has a $2,000 budget.
2. The Three-Tier Menu
You categorize the work internally (and on the quote you send them) into three buckets.
Tier 1: The "Standard" Memo ($750)
What it is: Routine transactions where your vLogic AI does 90% of the work.
Examples: Standard SaaS (ASC 606), Real Estate Lease (ASC 842), Simple Stock Option Grant (ASC 718).
Your Time: ~30-45 minutes (Reviewing the AI output).
Margin: Excellent. This is your volume play.
Tier 2: The "Complex" Memo ($1,500 - $2,000)
What it is: Requires human judgment, "whiteboarding" the accounting flow, or multiple document synthesis.
Examples: Software + Hardware + Professional Services bundles (allocation of transaction price), Contract Modifications, Debt Refinancing.
Your Time: 2-3 hours.
Margin: Good. This is where your expertise shines.
Tier 3: The "Special Project" (Custom Quote)
What it is: High risk, high complexity.
Examples: ASC 805 Business Combinations (Purchase Price Allocation memos), Variable Interest Entities, complex Equity/Debt instruments.
Pricing: Hourly or fixed project fee (e.g., $3,500+).
3. The Workflow (How to price it without friction)
You don't want a "Checkout Now" button because you need to see the contract first.
The Process:
Website: CTA says "Get a Free Quote & Initial Review."
Intake: They upload the contract (or NDA first).
The Triage (Your "Secret Sauce"): You look at the contract for 5 minutes.
If it looks standard, you reply: "Confirmed. I can draft this for our Standard Rate of $750. Delivery by Thursday."
If it looks hairy, you reply: "I've reviewed the agreement. Due to the complex revenue allocation/modification clauses, this falls under our Complex tier ($1,500). However, this includes a specific analysis of the [Specific Clause] to ensure audit readiness."
4. Revised Pricing Section for HTML
Here is how I would modify the pricing section in the HTML instructions for your developer to reflect this nuance.
Replace the previous pricing block with this:
code
Html
<section class="service-pricing">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Transparent, Flat-Fee Pricing</h2>
            <p>Expert technical accounting memos. No hourly billing surprises.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pricing-grid">
            
            <!-- Standard Tier -->

Why this works for you (The VP with a Day Job):
Screening: It stops people from sending you a massive M&A deal expecting a $750 output.
Upsell: If they come in for the $750 tier but the contract is complex, you have a justified reason to bump them to $1,500.
Speed: You can likely knock out the $750 memos on your lunch break or in the evening using vLogic. The $1,500 ones are your weekend work.
