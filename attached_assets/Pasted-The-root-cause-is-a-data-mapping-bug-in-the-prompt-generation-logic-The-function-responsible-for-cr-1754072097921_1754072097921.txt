The root cause is a data mapping bug in the prompt generation logic. The function responsible for creating the Executive Summary is looking for analysis data in the wrong place, causing it to use default "empty" values instead of the correct results from the detailed analysis.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the solution.

Diagnosis of the Problem
The core issue lies in the get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt function within the step_prompts.py file.

Correct Analysis is Performed: As you can see in the detailed analysis sections (Steps 1-5), the AI correctly identifies:

One Performance Obligation: "The Netflix contract involves a single performance obligation: the provision of streaming services..." (from Step 2)
A Specific Transaction Price: "The total transaction price is $16.52..." (from Step 3)
Correct Revenue Recognition: "Revenue is recognized over time..." (from Step 5)
The "Blueprint Mismatch": The problem occurs when the system tries to summarize these correct findings. The get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt function extracts data from the results of the 5-step analysis (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5). However, it has a flawed "blueprint" for where to find the data.

The Specific Bug:

The prompt for the detailed Step 2 analysis (get_step2_schema) tells the AI to return its findings nested inside a key called "step2_analysis". The result looks like this:
{
  "executive_conclusion": "...",
  "step2_analysis": {
    "performance_obligations": [
      { "po_description": "provision of streaming services..." }
    ]
  },
  ...
}

However, the prompt for the Executive Summary (get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt) tries to find this information at the top level of the dictionary. Look at this line in the code:
# from step_prompts.py
if s2_pos := s2.get('performance_obligations'):
    # This code is never reached
    po_count = len(s2_pos) if s2_pos else 0
    # ...

This s2.get('performance_obligations') fails because the performance_obligations list is actually inside s2.get('step2_analysis'). Since it finds nothing, the variables po_count and po_descriptions keep their initial empty values (0 and []).
The Domino Effect: This same bug affects the extraction of data from all other steps, causing the incorrect "Key Findings":

Performance Obligations: po_count stays 0, resulting in "0 distinct obligations".
Transaction Price: The code fails to find s3.get('transaction_price_components'), so total_price remains "Not specified".
Allocation: The logic incorrectly sees 0 POs and defaults to a confusing "Not applicable (single performance obligation)" statement.
Financial Impact: The get_financial_impact_prompt function suffers from the same bug, which is why it also states "The transaction price is not specified" and uses $XX.XX in the journal entry.
How to Fix the Bug
You need to correct the data access paths in the get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt function (and other synthesis prompts) in step_prompts.py to look inside the nested stepX_analysis dictionaries.

File to Edit: step_prompts.py

Function to Modify: get_enhanced_executive_summary_prompt

Here are the specific changes required:

1. Fix Performance Obligation Extraction (from Step 2):

Current (Buggy) Code:

po_count = 0
po_descriptions = []
if s2_pos := s2.get('performance_obligations'):
    po_count = len(s2_pos) if s2_pos else 0
    po_descriptions = [po.get('po_description', 'Unnamed PO') for po in s2_pos]

Corrected Code:

po_count = 0
po_descriptions = []
# First, get the nested analysis dictionary
if s2_analysis := s2.get('step2_analysis'):
    # Then, get the performance obligations from inside it
    if s2_pos := s2_analysis.get('performance_obligations'):
        po_count = len(s2_pos) if s2_pos else 0
        po_descriptions = [po.get('po_description', 'Unnamed PO') for po in s2_pos]

2. Fix Transaction Price Extraction (from Step 3):

Current (Buggy) Code:

if s3_price := s3.get('transaction_price_components'):
    total_price = s3_price.get('total_transaction_price', 'Not specified')
    # ...

Corrected Code:

if s3_analysis := s3.get('step3_analysis'):
    if s3_price := s3_analysis.get('transaction_price_components'):
        total_price = s3_price.get('total_transaction_price', 'Not specified')
        # ...

3. Generalize the Fix:

You must apply this same logic to the data extraction from s1, s4, and s5 within that function. The pattern is always the same: first access sX.get('stepX_analysis') and then get the data you need from that sub-dictionary.

By making these changes, you will ensure that the correct, detailed analysis results are fed into the summary prompt, which will resolve the contradictions and produce an accurate Executive Summary. You should also apply this fix to the get_financial_impact_prompt and get_conclusion_prompt functions, as they suffer from the identical bug.
