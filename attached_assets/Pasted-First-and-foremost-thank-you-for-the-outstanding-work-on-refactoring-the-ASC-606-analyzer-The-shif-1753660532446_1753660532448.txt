First and foremost, thank you for the outstanding work on refactoring the ASC 606 analyzer. The shift to the step-by-step architecture is a huge success. The new prompts are vastly more detailed, and the overall workflow is exactly what we need to generate the deep, evidence-backed analysis this application requires.

I've completed a comprehensive review of asc606_analyzer.py, models.py, prompt.py, and the new step_prompts.py. My goal with this feedback is to partner with you to push our application from a "functionally excellent" state to a "bulletproof, production-ready" system. The foundation you've built is incredibly strong; these recommendations are designed to perfect it.

Here is a breakdown of my findings by file.

1. asc606_analyzer.py - The Orchestrator
This file has seen the most improvement and is the core of our new system. The logic is sound. My feedback focuses on making it more intelligent and resilient.

Praise:

The implementation of the 5-step analysis loop is perfect.
The cost-optimization to use gpt-4o-mini for the final assembly is a smart, production-aware decision.
The internal error handling for JSON parsing is a great start.
Actionable Refinements:

High-Impact: Make RAG Step-Specific.

Finding: The current RAG process runs once at the beginning, providing the same generic guidance to all five specialized prompts.
Recommendation: Let's move the RAG query inside the 5-step loop. For each step, we should perform a new, targeted RAG search using keywords specific to that step. This will provide more precise context to each prompt and significantly improve the quality of the analysis.
Critical UX: Don't Fail Silently.

Finding: If a step's JSON parsing fails, the process continues, potentially leading to an incomplete memo without warning the user.
Recommendation: After the 5-step loop completes, let's add a check for any steps that resulted in an error. If failures are found, we should halt execution and use st.error() to clearly inform the user which step(s) failed. This transparency is crucial for user trust.
Minor Optimization: Leaner Final Prompt.

Finding: The full contract_data object is passed to the final memo generation prompt.
Recommendation: Let's trim this call to only pass the data explicitly needed by the assembly prompt (like analysis_title). This keeps our API calls lean and efficient.
2. models.py - The Data Contracts
A well-structured data model is the backbone of a stable application. This one is very good, but we can make it cleaner and more aligned with best practices.

Praise:

The ContractData Pydantic model is comprehensive and correctly mirrors the UI inputs.
The multi-standard structure (ASC842Analysis, etc.) is forward-thinking.
Actionable Refinements:

High-Impact: Consolidate Redundant Fields in ASC606Analysis.

Finding: The ASC606Analysis dataclass contains both the old summary fields (step1_contract_identification, etc.) and the new detailed field (step_by_step_details). It also has both professional_memo and five_step_analysis. This is redundant and can cause confusion.
Recommendation: Let's simplify and consolidate. The step_by_step_details dictionary should be the single source of truth for the detailed analysis. The individual stepX_... fields can be removed. Similarly, let's pick one field for the final memo (professional_memo is standard) and remove the other. If the UI needs the summary data, we can derive it from step_by_step_details when needed.
Best Practice: Use Pydantic Consistently.

Finding: ContractData uses Pydantic (which is great for validation), but ASC606Analysis uses @dataclass.
Recommendation: Let's convert ASC606Analysis to also be a BaseModel from Pydantic. This gives us consistent, powerful data validation and serialization across our entire data flow, making the system more robust and predictable.
3. prompt.py & step_prompts.py - The AI's Instructions
The new prompt architecture is the star of the show. My feedback focuses on cleaning up the old and refining the new.

Praise:

The new step_prompts.py file is excellent. The prompts are detailed, strict, and force the AI to "show its work." The step-specific focus areas are a brilliant addition.
The structured JSON output required by the new prompts is exactly what we need for a reliable system.
Actionable Refinements:

Code Hygiene: Remove Legacy Prompts.

Finding: The prompt.py file still contains the old, monolithic get_analysis_prompt and its helpers, which are no longer used.
Recommendation: Let's delete this legacy code from prompt.py to eliminate technical debt and ensure clarity for future development.
Prompt Reliability: Simplify the Final Assembly Prompt.

Finding: The get_final_memo_generation_prompt is very prescriptive, telling the AI to "Incorporate ALL ASC 606 citations," "Present ALL supporting contract evidence," etc.
Recommendation: We can make this prompt simpler and more reliable. Since the step-specific JSON objects already contain the fully formatted analysis, we can simplify the final prompt's instructions to be more like a template: "For each step, take the content from the 'detailed_analysis' key and present it under the appropriate heading. Then, list all items from the 'asc_606_citations' key." This is less conversational and more of a direct "fill-in-the-blanks" instruction, which reduces the chance of the assembly LLM making a mistake or trying to re-analyze the content.
Summary & Next Steps
This is an exceptional round of development. You've successfully built the new, more powerful analysis engine.

I propose we prioritize the refinements in this order:

Critical: Address the data model and silent failure issues in asc606_analyzer.py and models.py.
High-Impact: Implement the step-specific RAG logic.
Cleanup: Remove the legacy code from prompt.py.
Refinement: Simplify the final assembly prompt.
Thank you again for your excellent work. I'm looking forward to seeing these refinements implemented, as they will make our application truly world-class.

Best regards,
