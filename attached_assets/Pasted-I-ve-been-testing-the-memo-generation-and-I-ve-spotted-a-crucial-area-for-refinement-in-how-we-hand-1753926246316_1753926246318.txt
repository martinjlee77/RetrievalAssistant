I've been testing the memo generation, and I've spotted a crucial area for refinement in how we handle the "Key Professional Judgments" section.

The Issue: For simple contracts (like a standard Netflix subscription), the AI is currently treating the routine application of the five-step model as a "key judgment." For example, it's flagging "revenue is recognized over time" as a key judgment, which isn't accurate for a simple subscription. This makes the memo seem less professional and inflates the complexity of straightforward deals.

The Goal: We need to make the system much stricter about what it presents as a "key judgment." This section should be reserved for true "gray areas" that require significant estimation or a choice between viable accounting alternatives. For simple contracts, this section should explicitly state that no significant judgments were required.

Proposed Technical Plan (A Two-Pronged Approach):

To solve this, I believe we need to tighten up the logic at both the identification stage and the final presentation stage.

Part 1: Stricter Judgment Identification (In the Step-Analysis Prompts)

The root of the issue likely starts in the prompts for the five individual step analyses. They might be too easily flagging items.

Action: Could you please review the five prompts used in the concurrent make_llm_call_async loop? We need to add a strict instruction to each of them.
Suggested Instruction to Add:
"Only populate the key_judgments_for_step field if the analysis required a significant estimation (e.g., variable consideration) or a choice between multiple viable accounting treatments (e.g., whether a service is distinct). The standard application of a rule to a simple fact pattern is NOT a key judgment. If no such judgment exists for this step, you must return an empty list [] for this field."

Part 2: Stricter Judgment Presentation (In get_key_judgments_prompt)

Next, we need to make the final prompt that assembles this section much more defensive and give it an "off-ramp" for simple contracts.

Action: Please replace the current get_key_judgments_prompt in utils/step_prompts.py with the more robust version below.
Proposed New Prompt:
@staticmethod
def get_key_judgments_prompt(s1: dict, s2: dict, s3: dict, s4: dict, s5: dict) -> str:
    """Generates a highly discerning prompt for the Key Professional Judgments section."""

    all_judgments = []
    for i, step in enumerate([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5], 1):
        judgments = step.get('key_judgments_for_step', [])
        if judgments:
            all_judgments.extend(judgments)

    # If, after stricter identification, no judgments were passed up, provide a standard statement.
    if not all_judgments:
        return "The accounting for this arrangement is considered straightforward under ASC 606 and did not require any significant professional judgments outside of the standard application of the five-step model."

    # If judgments were flagged, this prompt will act as a final quality filter.
    return f"""You are an accounting director writing the "Key Professional Judgments" section of an audit-ready ASC 606 memo. You must be highly discerning. Do not mistake standard analysis for a key judgment.

CONTEXT FROM ANALYSIS:
The following potential judgments were flagged during the five-step analysis:
{chr(10).join(all_judgments)}

YOUR TASK:
Review the list above. Write a formal summary of ONLY the items that represent a genuine professional judgment (i.e., a "gray area" requiring significant estimation or a choice between viable alternatives).

- **CRITICAL RULE:** If the items in the list above are merely restatements of standard ASC 606 application (e.g., "the service is distinct," "revenue is recognized over time for a subscription"), then DISREGARD THEM. In this case, your entire output must be only the following single sentence:
"The accounting for this arrangement is considered straightforward under ASC 606 and did not require any significant professional judgments outside of the standard application of the five-step model."

- If there are genuine judgments, present each one as a separate bullet point following this precise structure:
  - **Judgment:** State the judgment clearly.
  - **Analysis:** Explain the issue and the rationale for the conclusion.
  - **Authoritative Guidance:** Cite the specific ASC 606 guidance that supports the judgment.

Your reputation for precision is on the line. Do not overstate the complexity of a simple contract.
"""

This two-part change should ensure that the "Key Judgments" section is both accurate and intelligent, correctly identifying complexity when it exists and correctly stating when it doesn't.

Let me know your thoughts on this approach.

Thanks,
