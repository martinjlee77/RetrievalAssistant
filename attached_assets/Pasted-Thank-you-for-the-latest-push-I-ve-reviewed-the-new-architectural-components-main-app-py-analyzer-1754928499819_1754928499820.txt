Thank you for the latest push. I've reviewed the new architectural components (main_app.py, analyzer_factory.py, and the updated knowledge_base_manager.py) as well as the initial build of the asc340 module.

The work on the platform's architecture is outstanding. The new st.navigation router and the analyzer_factory pattern are significant improvements that make the entire system more professional, scalable, and maintainable. This is exactly the high-quality foundation we need to support many future standards.

With the architecture now locked in, let's focus on the final implementation details for the ASC 340-40 module to fully align it with our "Accounting Policy Memo" objective.

Here are the key areas to address:

1. Critical UI Update (pages/asc340.py)
This is the most important next step. The current UI in asc340.py is a great starting point, but we need to replace the generic inputs with the specific, judgment-driving fields we finalized. These inputs are essential for the AI to generate a meaningful and defensible policy memo.

Please update Tab 2 ("Analysis Context") to include the following required and optional fields:

Field Name	UI Control	Status	Default Value
Cost Type	Dropdown	Required	Incremental Cost of Obtaining
Is recovery of costs probable?	Toggle	Required	Yes
Standard Amortization Period (in months)	Number Input	Required	36
Practical Expedient (â‰¤1 yr)	Toggle	Required	No
Contract Type Scope	Multi-select	Optional	(None)
Cost Timing	Dropdown	Optional	(None)
(Note: The Policy Title, Description, and Uploader in Tab 1 are good as-is.)

2. Refine AI Prompts for Policy Focus (utils/asc340_step_prompts.py)
The 4-step structure is perfect. Now, let's refine the content of the prompts to ensure the AI's output is consistently policy-focused.

General Tone: Please add a recurring instruction in each step's prompt, such as: "CRITICAL: Your analysis must establish a policy framework for [Company Name], not analyze a single transaction."
Step 3 (Measurement & Amortization): The prompt for this step needs to specifically instruct the AI to define a methodology for measurement based on the extracted policy terms, rather than calculating a single amount.
Step 4 (Illustrative Impact): Please update the prompt to explicitly instruct the AI to use a placeholder amount (e.g., $10,000) for the journal entry and to include a disclaimer that the entry is for illustrative purposes.
3. Implement "Extract Policy Terms" Logic (utils/asc340_analyzer.py)
As part of the Step 3 analysis, we need to implement the logic for extracting policy terms from the user-uploaded document. Please add a dedicated method within the ASC340Analyzer that:

Takes the text from the uploaded document.
Uses a targeted LLM call to identify and extract key policy clauses (e.g., "commission is 5% of TCV," "fixed fee of $2,500").
Feeds this extracted text as specific context into the main Step 3 analysis prompt.
This completes the loop, allowing the AI to ground its policy description in the user's source document.

The architectural work is complete and exceptionally well done. These final refinements to the asc340 module will ensure its output precisely matches our strategic goals.

Let me know if you have any questions about these implementation details. Fantastic progress!

Best,
