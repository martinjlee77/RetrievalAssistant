While the function is very strong, we can make it more robust, maintainable, and even more professional.

Improvement 1: Refactor the Parsing Logic for Robustness and Maintainability

The current line-by-line if/elif parsing works, but it can be brittle. For example, it might fail if there's no space after a ## or if a user wants to use italics (*text*). A more robust approach is to use a list of regular expressions.

Recommendation: Refactor the main parsing loop to be data-driven. This separates the "what to look for" from the "how to handle it."

Current (Simplified):

for line in lines:
    if stripped_line.startswith('# '):
        # handle heading 1
    elif stripped_line.startswith('## '):
        # handle heading 2
    ...

Proposed Refactor:

import re

def add_heading1(doc, match):
    doc.add_paragraph(match.group(1), style='Custom Heading 1')

def add_bullet(doc, match):
    p = doc.add_paragraph(style='List Bullet')
    _parse_text_formatting(p, match.group(1)) # Your existing bold parser

# Create a list of rules: (regex, handler_function)
# Order matters: more specific rules first.
parse_rules = [
    (re.compile(r'^#\s(.*?)$'), add_heading1),
    # Add rules for h2, h3...
    (re.compile(r'^\*\s(.*?)$'), add_bullet),
    # Add rules for numbered lists, blockquotes...
]

# In the main loop:
for line in lines:
    was_handled = False
    for pattern, handler in parse_rules:
        match = pattern.match(line.strip())
        if match:
            handler(document, match)
            was_handled = True
            break
    if not was_handled:
        # It's a normal paragraph
        p = document.add_paragraph()
        _parse_text_formatting(p, line.strip())

Benefit: This makes the parser much easier to extend (e.g., to add italics) and more resilient to small formatting variations.

Improvement 2: Enhance Table Formatting

The current table parser is good but assumes a specific "Contract Data Summary" format. It also hardcodes column widths.

Recommendation: Generalize the table parser to better handle any Markdown table and dynamically adjust column widths.

Better Regex: The current regex is r'\|\s*\*\*.*?\*\*\s*\|.*?\|'. A more general Markdown table regex would also look for the separator line (|---|---|).
Dynamic Widths: Instead of hardcoding widths, you can set the table to "autofit" or distribute the width equally among columns, which is a safer default.
# In your _add_contract_table function
table = doc.add_table(...)
table.autofit = True # Let Word handle the column widths
# OR, for more control:
# total_width = Inches(6.5)
# for col in table.columns:
#     col.width = total_width / len(headers)

Benefit: Your DOCX will correctly render any table the LLM produces, not just the ones you've anticipated.

Improvement 3: Trust, Then Verify the LLM's Structure

The DOCX function currently discards the LLM's main title (# TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING MEMORANDUM) and reconstructs it. This creates redundancy. A better pattern is to trust the LLM's output structure and have the DOCX function simply be a "renderer" for it.

Recommendation: Modify the parsing loop to start from the very first line of text_content. Let it parse the title, the ## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, etc., directly from the LLM's output using the improved parsing rules from Improvement #1. You can remove the hardcoded document.add_paragraph("TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING MEMORANDUM") logic.

Benefit: This creates a single source of truth for the memo's content and structure. If you change the prompt to create a different kind of memo, the DOCX function will automatically adapt without needing code changes.

By implementing these changes, you will elevate an already excellent function to a truly robust, maintainable, and production-grade component of your application.
