The objective of this memorandum is to document the Company's accounting analysis and conclusions for the transaction with the customer under the five-step model of ASC 606.

3. DETAILED ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Conclusion:
The contract between InnovateTech Solutions Inc. and Global Dynamics Corp. meets the criteria for a valid contract under ASC 606, assuming collectibility is probable based on management's credit assessment.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Approval and Commitment

The primary issue is whether both parties have approved and are committed to the contract. The SOW states that it is entered into by InnovateTech and Global Dynamics under the terms of the Master Services Agreement, indicating mutual approval and commitment. According to ASC 606-10-25-1(a), a contract exists only if both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations. The explicit reference to the Master Services Agreement and the detailed project scope and deliverables demonstrate that both parties have a clear understanding and commitment to the contract terms. Therefore, this criterion is met.

This Statement of Work ('SOW') is entered into as of October 26,2023, by and between InnovateTech Solutions Inc. ('InnovateTech') and Global Dynamics Corp. ('Customer'), under the terms of the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated January 15,2022. (Source: gemini_sow.docx)

2. Identification of Rights

The issue is whether the contract clearly identifies the rights of each party. The SOW specifies the deliverables, including the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, hardware provisioning, and professional services, along with the responsibilities of Global Dynamics to make payments. ASC 606-10-25-1(b) requires that the rights regarding goods or services to be transferred are identifiable. The detailed description of deliverables and payment obligations ensures that both parties' rights are clearly identified, thus meeting this criterion.

3. Identification of Payment Terms

The issue is whether the payment terms are clearly identified in the contract. The SOW outlines specific payment terms for each deliverable, including the amounts and due dates for the SaaS license, hardware, and professional services. According to ASC 606-10-25-1(c), a contract must have identifiable payment terms. The clarity and specificity of the payment schedule in the SOW ensure that this criterion is met.

4. Commercial Substance

The issue is whether the contract has commercial substance. The SOW indicates that the transaction will result in a change in cash flows, with InnovateTech providing valuable services and products in exchange for payment from Global Dynamics. ASC 606-10-25-1(d) requires that a contract must have commercial substance, meaning it is expected to affect the cash flows of the parties involved. The nature of the deliverables and the payment terms confirm that the contract has commercial substance, thus meeting this criterion.

5. Collectibility

The assessment of collectibility under ASC 606 is based on a customer's ability and intent to pay the consideration to which the entity is entitled. This requires an analysis of the customer's financial capacity and intention to pay, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, including historical payment experience. As this analysis requires information external to the contract documents, it is assumed for the purpose of this initial memo that collection is probable and this criterion is met. This assumption must be validated by management's credit assessment of the customer. If it is determined that collection is not probable, this conclusion must be revisited, as a valid contract under ASC 606 would not exist.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Conclusion:
The contract identifies three distinct performance obligations: the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license, the OptiScan-7 hardware, and the professional services, each capable of being distinct and separately identifiable under ASC 606-10-25-19.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License

The primary issue is whether the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license is a distinct performance obligation. The contract specifies a 3-year subscription license granting access for up to 500 users, including standard support and maintenance (Source: gemini_sow.docx). According to ASC 606-10-25-19(a), the SaaS license is capable of being distinct as the customer can benefit from it on its own or with other readily available resources. Under ASC 606-10-25-19(b), the SaaS license is separately identifiable because it does not require significant integration with other services, nor does it significantly modify or customize other elements. The SaaS license provides a series of distinct services (monthly updates) that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer, thus qualifying as a series under ASC 606-10-25-14. Therefore, the SaaS license is a distinct performance obligation. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view might suggest that the SaaS license is not distinct due to its integration with the customer's systems. However, the contract states that the SaaS can be used without integration, and the updates are routine, supporting its distinctness.

2. OptiScan-7 Hardware

The issue is whether the OptiScan-7 hardware is a distinct performance obligation. The contract states that InnovateTech will provide 200 proprietary handheld scanners, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery (Source: gemini_sow.docx). According to ASC 606-10-25-19(a), the hardware is capable of being distinct as it can be used independently or with other readily available resources. Under ASC 606-10-25-19(b), the hardware is separately identifiable because it does not require significant integration with the SaaS or services, nor does it significantly modify or customize other elements. The hardware is not part of a series of distinct goods or services. Therefore, the hardware is a distinct performance obligation. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view might argue that the hardware is not distinct due to its optimal use with the SaaS. However, the hardware can function independently, and its transfer of title upon delivery supports its distinctness.

3. Professional Services

The issue is whether the professional services are a distinct performance obligation. The contract outlines a one-time engagement for implementation, system integration, and on-site user training, which significantly enhances the SaaS's functionality (Source: gemini_sow.docx). According to ASC 606-10-25-19(a), the services are capable of being distinct as they enhance the SaaS's functionality but are not required for its use. Under ASC 606-10-25-19(b), the services are separately identifiable as they do not require significant integration with the SaaS or hardware, nor do they significantly modify or customize other elements. The services are not part of a series of distinct goods or services. Therefore, the professional services are a distinct performance obligation. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view might suggest that the services are not distinct due to their integration role. However, the contract indicates that the SaaS can be used without these services, and they are completed upon acceptance, supporting their distinctness.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price for the contract is determined to be $862,500, comprising both fixed and variable considerations, with no significant financing or noncash components identified.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Fixed Consideration

$832,500, comprising $720,000 for the SaaS license, $50,000 for hardware, and $75,000 for professional services.

2. Variable Consideration

The contract includes a $30,000 performance bonus contingent on achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs, which is considered variable consideration.

3. Other Considerations

The contract includes a 10% bundle discount on hardware and services, which is factored into the fixed consideration.

4. Performance Bonus as Variable Consideration

The issue is whether the performance bonus should be included in the transaction price as variable consideration. The contract specifies a $30,000 performance bonus if a 15% reduction in shipping costs is achieved within the first 12 months (Source: gemini_sow.docx). According to ASC 606-10-32-8, variable consideration should be estimated using either the expected value or the most likely amount, and included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Given InnovateTech's track record of achieving this metric with 80% of similar customers, it is reasonable to include the bonus in the transaction price. Therefore, the performance bonus is considered part of the transaction price, reflecting the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price should be allocated to each performance obligation based on their relative Standalone Selling Prices (SSP), considering the discount and variable considerations as outlined in ASC 606.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Allocation of Transaction Price

The primary issue is how to allocate the transaction price among the identified performance obligations. The contract specifies a total transaction price of $315,000, which includes a SaaS license, hardware, and professional services. According to ASC 606-10-32-28, the transaction price must be allocated based on the relative Standalone Selling Prices (SSP) of each performance obligation. The SSP for the SaaS license is the standard rate, while the hardware SSP is based on observable standalone sales, and the professional services SSP is estimated using a cost-plus-margin approach. Therefore, the transaction price is allocated as $240,000 to the SaaS license, $45,000 to the hardware, and $67,500 to the professional services.

2. Variable Consideration Allocation

The issue is whether the variable consideration should be allocated to a specific performance obligation. The contract includes a $30,000 performance bonus contingent on achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs. ASC 606-10-32-39 allows variable consideration to be allocated to a specific performance obligation if it relates entirely to that obligation. Since the bonus is directly tied to the SaaS license's performance, it should be allocated entirely to the SaaS license.

3. Discount Allocation

The issue is how to allocate the 10% discount applied to the contract. ASC 606-10-32-37 states that discounts should be allocated proportionally to all performance obligations unless they relate to a specific obligation. The contract specifies a 10% discount on hardware and services, implying it should be allocated proportionally to these obligations, reducing the allocated amounts for hardware and professional services.

The total fees outlined above reflect a 10% discount on the standard standalone list prices for the hardware and services. (Source: gemini_sow.docx)

Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Conclusion:
Revenue recognition for the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license, hardware provisioning, and professional services will be determined based on the specific transfer of control and satisfaction of performance obligations, with each being evaluated under ASC 606 criteria.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License Recognition

The primary issue is whether the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license should be recognized over time or at a point in time. The contract specifies a 3-year subscription license with ongoing access and monthly updates, indicating a continuous transfer of benefits. According to ASC 606-10-25-27(a), revenue is recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance. The nature of a SaaS license, which provides ongoing access and updates, aligns with this criterion. Therefore, the SaaS license revenue is recognized over time using a straight-line method, as it best depicts the transfer of control evenly over the contract period. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view might consider recognizing revenue at the start of the contract; however, this was rejected because the customer does not receive the full benefit upfront, and the service is provided continuously over the contract term.

2. Hardware Provisioning Recognition

The issue is determining the appropriate timing for revenue recognition of the OptiScan-7 scanners. The contract states that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon delivery, which is a key indicator of control transfer per ASC 606-10-25-30. This aligns with the point in time recognition model, as the customer gains control, including legal title and risks and rewards of ownership, upon delivery. Therefore, revenue for the hardware is recognized at the point of delivery. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view might suggest recognizing revenue over time if the hardware was integral to a service; however, since the hardware is delivered and control is transferred independently, this view is not applicable.

3. Professional Services Recognition

The issue is when to recognize revenue for the professional services provided. The contract specifies that these services are complete upon the customer's written acceptance, which indicates the transfer of control. According to ASC 606-10-25-30, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has accepted the service, demonstrating control transfer. Thus, revenue for professional services is recognized at the point of customer acceptance. Alternative View Rejected: An alternative view could consider recognizing revenue over time as services are performed; however, without customer acceptance, control is not considered transferred, making point in time recognition more appropriate.

4. KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS
Collectibility Assumption:
Rationale: The determination of collectibility as probable is a significant judgment because the contract text does not provide sufficient external financial information regarding the customerâ€™s creditworthiness. According to ASC 606-10-30-3, collectibility must be assessed to determine whether a contract exists. The absence of explicit terms in the contract necessitates reliance on managementâ€™s estimation and interpretation of the customerâ€™s ability to pay. This lack of clarity in the contract, combined with the general principles outlined in ASC 606, requires us to exercise professional judgment to assess collectibility, making it a key area of focus.

Variable Consideration Inclusion:
Rationale: The inclusion of the performance bonus in the transaction price represents a significant judgment due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding variable consideration. While ASC 606-10-32-2 allows for the estimation of variable consideration, the contract text does not explicitly define the criteria for achieving the performance bonus. The estimation is further complicated by the need to evaluate the likelihood of achieving the target based on historical data, which is not directly addressed in the authoritative guidance. This reliance on managementâ€™s historical experience and interpretation of the likelihood of achieving the performance metric necessitates a careful judgment call, highlighting its complexity.

Standalone Selling Price (SSP) Estimation:
Rationale: Estimating the SSP for professional services is a key judgment area due to the absence of observable standalone sales data in the contract text. ASC 606-10-32-31 permits the use of estimation methods when observable prices are not available. In this case, we utilized a cost-plus-margin approach, which is a common practice in the absence of direct comparables. This reliance on managementâ€™s estimation to bridge the gap between the lack of specific pricing information and the requirements of ASC 606 makes this judgment particularly significant and complex.

SaaS License Recognition:
Rationale: The determination of the SaaS license as a right to access requires significant judgment due to the ambiguity in the contract text regarding the nature of the intellectual property and the simultaneous consumption of benefits by the customer. ASC 606-10-55-60 provides general guidance on recognizing licenses but does not offer definitive criteria for distinguishing between a right to access versus a right to use. This necessitates an interpretation of the nature of the service provided and how the customer benefits from it over time, which is not explicitly outlined in the authoritative guidance. Consequently, this area requires a nuanced understanding and professional judgment, underscoring its complexity.

5. FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The contract with the customer includes three distinct performance obligations: the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, OptiScan-7 Hardware, and Professional Services, with a total transaction price of $862,500. The revenue recognition methods vary, with the SaaS license recognized over time, while the hardware and professional services are recognized at a point in time. As a result, upon contract signing, a deferred revenue liability will be established for the total transaction price, reflecting the obligation to deliver the promised goods and services. The balance sheet will reflect a receivable for the total amount invoiced, while the income statement will recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

Internal Control & Process Considerations
To ensure accurate accounting and effective control over financial reporting, it is essential to implement internal controls that track the satisfaction of performance obligations, particularly for the SaaS license recognized over time. This may include monitoring usage metrics and customer satisfaction to confirm that the performance obligations are being met as expected. Additionally, processes should be established to ensure timely recognition of revenue for the point-in-time obligations, such as hardware delivery and professional services.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the accounting treatment outlined in this memo is appropriate and in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue for the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license is recognized over time, while revenue for the OptiScan-7 hardware and professional services is recognized at a point in time. This conclusion was reached after careful consideration of key judgments regarding collectibility assumptions, variable consideration inclusion, SSP estimation, and SaaS license recognition, which are detailed in Section 4 of this memo. Given the presence of variable consideration in this contract, ongoing monitoring will be necessary to ensure that revenue recognition remains aligned with the evolving circumstances surrounding the performance obligations.
