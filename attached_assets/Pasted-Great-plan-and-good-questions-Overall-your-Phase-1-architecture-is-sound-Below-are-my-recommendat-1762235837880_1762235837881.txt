Great plan and good questions. Overall, your Phase 1 architecture is sound. Below are my recommendations, concrete decisions, and a few tweaks so you can build without rework and make the AppSource offer attractive but sustainable.

Summary decisions (recommended)

Subscription model: Monthly dollar credit bank with rollover (Option B), not fixed-size analyses. Add a small bonus to make subs attractive, keep a clear cap to limit liability.
Rollover: Yes, with a cap. Rollover up to 2x the plan’s monthly credit amount; credits expire after 12 months.
Overflow: Allow self-serve top-up credits for Individual/Professional; for Team, notify admin and allow admin-only top-ups or upgrade. Soft block for team users when out.
Auth: Keep email/password for solos. Require Azure AD SSO for Team/Enterprise. Support account linking so an email user can join an Azure AD org later.
API: One API server (expand backend_api.py with new routes). Simpler deploy, fewer moving parts.
Hosting: Stay on Railway for Phase 1. Prepare a light “Phase 3” migration plan to Azure if/when enterprise asks.
AppSource pricing: Use subscription prices that offer a clear (but not excessive) discount vs a la carte, plus modest monthly credit “bonus.” See numbers below.
Review of your dev’s plan

Directory layout and FastAPI shim: Good. I’d unify API functions into one server rather than running a second on port 8000 to avoid CORS and ops complexity.
Refactor to shared/memo_generator.py: Critical first task. Make the generate_memo() signature stable now; everything else can wrap it.
Multitenancy: Add orgs, plans, entitlements, usage, audit_log. Also add a topup_ledger table to keep a clean audit trail of purchased credits.
Idempotency and rate limits: Add an idempotency_key on submissions and a simple per-org rate limit to avoid accidental double charges.
Concrete choices for the eight decisions

DECISION 1: Subscription tier strategy

Choose Option B (credit bank). Keep it in dollars to minimize user confusion: “You get $X of analysis each month, at our published per-analysis rates.”
Add a small bonus to make subscriptions attractive but sustainable:
Monthly plans: +10% bonus credits
Annual prepaid plans: +25% bonus credits
Example mapping:
Starter 
149
/
m
o
→
149/mo→165 credits/mo
Professional 
349
/
m
o
→
349/mo→385 credits/mo
Team 
999
/
m
o
→
999/mo→1,150 credits/mo
Why: Users can mix sizes without support tickets. You avoid hard edge cases like “why can’t I run a 9K on Starter.”
DECISION 2: Rollover policy

Choose Option B with a cap:
Credits roll over and expire after 12 months (consistent with today).
Cap accumulated balance at 2x the plan’s monthly credit amount (prevents large liability build-up).
Show a simple credit balance widget and upcoming expirations.
DECISION 3: Mixed-auth UX

Approve your dev’s flow. Add explicit account linking:
If an email-only user is invited to a Team org (Azure AD), prompt one-time link of email account to Azure identity. After linking, default to Azure SSO.
Allow unlink only by org admin.
DECISION 4: Subscription overflow

Professional: Option B (self-serve top-ups). Message: “You’ve used your monthly credits. Reset in X days. Need more now? Buy a one-time pack.”
Team: Option C (soft block + admin notification). Team users see “out of credits”; only org admins can top-up or upgrade. Send email to admin with quick links to top-up or upgrade.
DECISION 5: Azure AD integration approach

Choose Option A (direct Azure AD multi-tenant) for Phase 1. You’re AppSource-first and targeting Microsoft tenants; keep dependencies low.
Keep a future flag to add Azure OpenAI routing if requested by a tenant.
DECISION 6: Database schema (approve with two additions)

Approve proposed tables and add:
topup_ledger: id, org_id, amount, source(stripe/microsoft), created_at
invoices: id, org_id, plan_id, period_start, period_end, amount, provider(stripe/msft), status
usage table: include idempotency_key, request_hash to dedupe.
analyses table: include input_word_count, tier_at_run (3k/9k/15k/30k/60k), llm_model_used.
DECISION 7: API architecture

Choose Option A: single API server. Add routes:
POST /api/memo/{standard}
GET /api/memo/status/{analysis_id}
POST /api/memo/cancel/{analysis_id} (optional)
Enforce entitlements in POST before enqueueing. Decrement credits on completion, not on submission.
DECISION 8: AppSource pricing

Recommend subscription pricing that’s clearly better than a la carte, but not loss-making:
Starter 
149
/
m
o
→
149/mo→165 credits (about one 9K analysis with small overage or one 9K every two months with rollover)
Professional 
349
/
m
o
→
349/mo→385 credits (close to two 9K per month at a slight discount)
Team 
999
/
m
o
→
999/mo→1,150 credits (roughly five to six 9K-equivalents over two months; team mixing)
Enterprise: private offer (SSO, region pinning, DPAs, SLAs)
Keep current a la carte pricing visible on your site for clarity.
Implementation details to avoid gotchas

Entitlement math
On subscribe/renew: entitlements[org].monthly_credit += plan_credit + bonus_credit; enforce cap on rollover balance (2x monthly plan credit).
On completion: deduct the a la carte price for the tier actually used (based on input processed words).
If insufficient balance: for Professional/Starter show buy-top-up; for Team notify admin.
Idempotency
Require an Idempotency-Key header from the client; store it on submission with a hash of inputs. If a duplicate arrives within 24h, return the existing analysis_id.
Pricing fairness
Display estimated “credit cost” before enqueuing based on detected word count/tier. If the doc exceeds the chosen tier after processing, either:
Fail gracefully and allow resubmit at a higher tier, or
Auto-upcharge credits with a confirmation step when initiating (cleaner UX).
Status page and metrics
Track queue wait, run time, fail rate by standard and tier. Show “systems normal/degraded” externally.
Partner Center/AppSource specifics (Phase 1)

Offer type: SaaS, non-transactable (Get it now – Free trial).
Free trial: “30-day free trial with $195 in analysis credits (one 9K analysis).”
Public copy: Replace “GPT-5” with “state-of-the-art large language models (e.g., GPT-4-class) with retrieval and guardrails. Azure OpenAI available on request.”
Required links: Privacy Policy, Terms, Subprocessors, Security Overview (2–3 pages), Support email, Status page.
Assets: 5 screenshots and a 2-minute video (upload → de-identify → analyze → memo with citations → DOCX/PDF export → history). Include the Azure AD sign-in moment.
Staying on Railway vs migrating to Azure

Not required to move for Phase 1. Keep Railway now for speed.
Prepare a simple migration plan (when asked):
Azure App Service (web/API), Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Storage (Blob for exports), Key Vault, optional Azure OpenAI endpoint.
Timeline: 1–2 weeks lift-and-shift once code is containerized.
Security/documentation checklist

Security whitepaper (2–3 pages): data flow, encryption in transit/at rest, retention/deletion defaults, subprocessors, access controls, logging/audit, incident response, model provider retention policy, option for Azure OpenAI.
Subprocessors page: OpenAI/Azure OpenAI, Railway, Stripe, email provider, file storage provider.
Remove any FASB codification verbatim text from samples; cite and summarize only.
Optional enhancements that help win IT quickly

Admin console for orgs: users, credit balance, top-up button, export usage CSV.
Simple audit log per org: user, event, timestamp (submitted, completed, downloaded).
Region preference setting (US-only default).
