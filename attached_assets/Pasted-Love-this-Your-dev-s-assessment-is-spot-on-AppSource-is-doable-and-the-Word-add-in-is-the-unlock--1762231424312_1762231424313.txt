Love this. Your dev’s assessment is spot on: AppSource is doable, and the Word add‑in is the unlock. Here’s a crisp plan, gaps to close, and answers to your questions so you can move fast with confidence.

Executive take

Phase 1: Non‑transactable SaaS listing on Microsoft Commercial Marketplace (surfaces in AppSource). Keep your Streamlit app. Add Azure AD SSO and a simple subscriptions layer. This is the fastest way to get discoverability and “click to try” without heavy refactor.
Phase 2: Word task‑pane add‑in that calls a thin API wrapper. This is the adoption multiplier and your differentiator.
Avoid “GPT‑5” in any listing. Use “state‑of‑the‑art LLMs (e.g., GPT‑4‑class)” or “Azure OpenAI compatible.”
Answers to your three questions

Azure AD requirement: Offer both. Keep email/password for self‑serve trials; enable Azure AD SSO for teams and make it required for Team/Enterprise plans. That satisfies IT without blocking small buyers.
Subscriptions vs credits: For Marketplace, subscriptions with included monthly analysis credits are simplest. Keep Stripe credit top‑ups on your site for overage until you add metered billing in Marketplace.
Do it yourself vs contractor: Given your current stack and goals, hire a contractor for 4–6 weeks to handle Azure AD SSO, the Marketplace SaaS listing, subscriptions, and the Word add‑in shell. You focus on templates, QA, and security docs.
Phase 1: AppSource (SaaS) checklist and plan What you need to ship (no Office add‑in yet)

Azure AD SSO (multi‑tenant OIDC). You can broker with Auth0 or WorkOS if that’s faster.
Subscription plans and entitlements:
Starter: 1 analysis/month
Professional: 3/month
Team: 10/month
Enterprise: custom/private offers Credits roll over 12 months; allow on‑site top‑ups via Stripe.
Minimal “SaaS landing page” in your app for Marketplace flows: handle free trial activation and plan selection.
Security and privacy docs: 2–3 pages covering data flow, encryption, retention/deletion, LLM provider settings, tenant isolation, incident response.
Publisher setup in Partner Center: verified domain, tax/payout, support contacts.
Steps and effort (2–4 weeks)

Week 1:
Implement Azure AD SSO; keep email/password alongside it.
Add plan table in DB; entitlement check on job submission.
Prepare privacy policy, terms, security whitepaper.
Week 2:
Create Commercial Marketplace SaaS offer in Partner Center (non‑transactable “Get it now” with free trial).
Listing assets: title, short/long descriptions, 5 screenshots, 2‑minute demo video, categories (Accounting, Compliance), industries.
Validate flows (sign‑up, SSO, submit job, see credits).
Week 3–4:
Microsoft validation fixes (if any).
Optional: move hosting to Azure App Service/Azure Postgres/Azure Blob for extra trust; not required but helps with IT questionnaires.
Non‑transactable vs transactable

Non‑transactable (start here): Fastest. Buyers click to your site to start a free trial and pay via Stripe.
Transactable (next): Implement Microsoft’s SaaS Fulfillment APIs (Resolve/Activate) and optional Metering. Buyers are billed via Microsoft; procurement is easier for many enterprises. Add this after you see inbound.
Phase 2: Word add‑in plan (4–6 weeks) Scope for v1

Word task pane for Windows/Mac/Web. Users sign in with Azure AD.
Inputs: paste facts or attach files; choose standard (606/842/etc).
Call your API; return a structured memo; insert as formatted DOCX sections; keep a “copy to clipboard” and “download DOCX/PDF.”
Show citations and a “disclaimer” box. Respect entitlements.
API shim (so you don’t rewrite your app)

POST /api/memo/{standard}
Input: text blocks, optional file URLs/IDs, options (sections on/off), tenant/user IDs.
Output: JSON { sections[], citations[], docx_url, pdf_url, analysis_id, confidence_score }.
POST /api/status/{analysis_id} to poll job status.
Auth: bearer tokens from Azure AD or your broker (Auth0/WorkOS).
The API simply wraps your existing generate_memo() flow and uses your Redis/RQ background worker.
Test matrix

Word on Windows (current channel), Mac, and Word Online.
Documents with and without existing styles; large memos; footnotes/bullets.
SSO flows across tenants; expired tokens; entitlement edge cases.
Accessibility: keyboard nav and basic screen‑reader labels.
Security and compliance tweaks before listing

Model provider language: say “OpenAI/Azure OpenAI with data not used for training; 0–30 day retention option.” Avoid “GPT‑5.”
FASB content: continue citing ASC paragraphs; do not reproduce codification text verbatim.
Data handling:
Keep “no storage of originals” default, but add an enterprise toggle for X‑day retention with secure deletion and region selection (US‑only).
Encrypt at rest/in transit; log access to memos; provide a basic audit trail.
Uptime/SLA:
Publish a status page (Statuspage/Better Uptime).
Health checks and autoscaling for the RQ worker and web app.
99.9% target is fine; Railway can be OK for MVP, but Azure App Service or Render with autoscaling is safer for an SLA.
Pricing recommendations for Marketplace

Starter $129/month (1 analysis)
Professional $395/month (3 analyses)
Team $995/month (10 analyses, Azure AD SSO, basic audit log)
Enterprise: private offer; SSO, region pinning, DPA, support SLAs Keep one‑off Stripe “top‑up credits” on your site until you add metered billing in Marketplace.
What Microsoft will actually check

Sign‑in works (Azure AD), free trial starts, core flow runs end‑to‑end.
Privacy policy, terms, and support links resolve; security summary is present.
Clear description, non‑misleading claims; no prohibited IP use.
Add‑in (Phase 2): functional test on Word Web/Windows/Mac; no crashes; basic accessibility.
Where your plan could stumble and how to avoid it

“GPT‑5” claims: remove in all public collateral. Use “leading LLMs/GPT‑4‑class” or “Azure OpenAI compatible.”
Tight Streamlit coupling: your dev’s 2–3 day refactor to a generate_memo() function is the critical step. Lock that in as Sprint 1.
Enterprise asks for Azure OpenAI: have a “switch” ready to route through Azure OpenAI if the customer demands it (same prompts, different endpoint).
Marketplace timing: Microsoft validations can bounce you once; budget 1–2 weeks for fixes.
Contractor scope (so you can delegate cleanly)

Deliverables:
Azure AD SSO integration
Subscription plans + entitlements + admin UI
Minimal API shim (FastAPI) for /api/memo endpoints
Non‑transactable Marketplace listing (assets + submission)
Word add‑in (task pane) MVP and AppSource submission
Skills: Python (FastAPI), Office.js/React, Azure AD OIDC, Stripe subscriptions, basic DevOps (Azure App Service/S3/Blob, Postgres).
Duration: 6–8 weeks part‑time or 4–6 weeks full‑time.
Your 30‑60 day execution timeline

Weeks 1–2: Refactor generate_memo(); add Azure AD SSO; add subscriptions/entitlements; produce security whitepaper (2–3 pages).
Weeks 3–4: Submit non‑transactable SaaS listing; stand up status page; optional deploy to Azure App Service/Azure Postgres/Blob.
Weeks 5–8: Build and submit Word add‑in; add API shim; record a 2‑minute demo; prepare a one‑pager for IT (SSO, retention, encryption, LLM data policy).
Weeks 7–10: If demand warrants, start transactable SaaS setup (Fulfillment APIs) and/or AWS Marketplace.
If you want, I can:

Draft the exact request/response JSON for /api/memo/asc606 and /api/memo/asc842.
Provide an AppSource SaaS offer checklist tailored to your listing (fields, screenshots, video script, security Q&A).
Share a lightweight security whitepaper outline you can fill in to pass IT review.
