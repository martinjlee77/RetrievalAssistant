RE: ASC 606 Analysis for Test01  

**Executive Summary:**  
This memorandum provides a detailed analysis of the revenue recognition process for Test01 under ASC 606. The analysis confirms the existence of a contract, identifies performance obligations, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to performance obligations, and outlines the revenue recognition pattern. The conclusions are based on authoritative sources and are intended to guide the accurate recognition of revenue for the specified service period.

**Step 1: Contract Identification**  
The analysis confirms the existence of a contract, supported by an invoice and terms of use. The contract outlines a service period from September 26, 2024, to October 25, 2024, with a fixed price of $15.49, payable via credit card. This contract is deemed authoritative and forms the basis for subsequent analysis.

**Step 2: Performance Obligations**  
The identified performance obligation is the provision of a streaming service. The service is distinct and separately identifiable, allowing the customer to benefit from it independently. This distinctness is crucial for the accurate allocation of the transaction price.

**Step 3: Transaction Price Determination**  
The transaction price is fixed at $15.49, with no variable consideration identified. This fixed price is derived from the subscription plan and is authoritative for revenue allocation purposes.

**Step 4: Allocation of Transaction Price**  
The transaction price is allocated using the Relative Standalone Selling Price (SSP) Method. Given that there is a single performance obligation, the entire price of $15.49 is allocated to the streaming service. This allocation is based on authoritative assumptions and ensures compliance with ASC 606.

**Step 5: Revenue Recognition**  
Revenue from the streaming service is recognized over time, consistent with the service period. The implementation step involves recognizing revenue evenly throughout the duration of the contract, ensuring that revenue recognition aligns with the delivery of the service.

**Key Judgments and Implementation Guidance:**  
- The streaming service is a distinct performance obligation, allowing for straightforward allocation of the transaction price.
- Revenue should be recognized evenly over the service period, reflecting the continuous delivery of the service.
- The analysis is based on authoritative sources, ensuring compliance with ASC 606 standards.

This analysis provides a comprehensive framework for recognizing revenue in accordance with ASC 606, ensuring that financial reporting is both accurate and compliant. Please implement the outlined steps to ensure proper revenue recognition for the specified service period.
