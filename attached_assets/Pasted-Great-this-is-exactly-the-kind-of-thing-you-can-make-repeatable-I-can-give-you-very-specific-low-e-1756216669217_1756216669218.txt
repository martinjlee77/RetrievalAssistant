Great—this is exactly the kind of thing you can make repeatable. I can give you very specific, low-effort steps and a reusable “template + checklist” you (and Replit) can follow. To tailor that precisely, here’s what I need to see from your repo, in priority order.

What files I need to review (prioritized)

Entry point and navigation
main.py or app.py (how pages are registered and routed)
Any router/nav component (e.g., sidebar/menu code)
ASC 606 reference implementation (this is your template)
asc606/asc606_page.py
asc606/step_analyzer.py
asc606/knowledge_search.py
utils/asc606_step_prompts.py
Any memo template(s) used by ASC 606 (if not inside shared/memo_generator.py)
Shared components you plan to reuse
shared/document_processor.py
shared/knowledge_base.py (ChromaDB config, collection naming)
shared/ui_components.py
shared/memo_generator.py
Any shared config/constants files (e.g., shared/config.py)
ASC 340-40 current work
asc340/* (whatever exists: page/analyzer/knowledge_search/prompts)
The errors you hit when enabling the page (tracebacks or logs)
Knowledge base seeding and data layout
Any scripts for seeding ChromaDB (scripts/seed_*.py or similar)
Where the source docs live (e.g., data/asc606/, data/asc340/)
How collection names are chosen (env var, code constant, etc.)
Dependencies and Replit setup
requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
replit.md (current contents)
Any Replit config (replit.nix, replit.yaml, etc., if present)
With those, I can give concrete diffs or a small scaffold script tailored to your codebase.

In the meantime: a simple, low-risk plan you can start now Goal: Make 340-40 work by cloning the 606 pattern with minimal changes, then turn that into a repeatable template for future standards (842, 718, etc.).

Phase A — Ship ASC 340-40 quickly (copy/adapt the ASC 606 pattern)

Directory pattern (match 606)
asc340/asc340_page.py
asc340/step_analyzer.py
asc340/knowledge_search.py
utils/asc340_step_prompts.py
Use the same shared/* modules
Keep the architecture identical; only change:
Standard identifier (e.g., STANDARD_CODE = "asc340_40")
ChromaDB collection name (e.g., asc_340_40)
Step list (4 steps for 340-40 vs 5 for 606)
Prompts (use your simpler 4-step prompts)
The memo header/section names (if 340-40 has different sections)
Hook into the app
Add ASC 340-40 to the nav and ensure asc340_page.py renders
Verify document upload and knowledge search pull from the new collection
Seed the knowledge base
Ensure your seeding script creates/populates the asc_340_40 collection using the 340-40 docs you already chunked
Test end-to-end
Upload a 340-40 scenario, run through the 4 steps, generate memo
Phase B — Make it repeatable (light template + checklist) Once 340-40 is working, make a minimal “template” to avoid re-coding for 842/718:

Create a template folder: standards_template/
page.py (uses placeholders like {{STANDARD_CODE}}, {{DISPLAY_NAME}})
step_analyzer.py (drives a steps list from a config)
knowledge_search.py
prompts.py (list of step prompts)
Move repeated logic into a tiny base layer if needed:
BaseStandardPage (shared layout + step progression)
BaseStepAnalyzer (common RAG loop)
BaseKnowledgeSearch (wrapping the shared/knowledge_base.py calls)
Add a small “scaffold_standard.py” script that copies standards_template into ascXXX/, does simple string replacements, and registers the page in your nav
You don’t have to go fully “config-driven” yet; basic copy-with-replacements gets you 90% of the benefit with minimal effort.

A “New Standard” checklist you and Replit can follow Use this each time you add ASC 842, 718, etc.

Inputs

STANDARD_CODE (e.g., asc842)
DISPLAY_NAME (e.g., ASC 842 — Leases)
COLLECTION_NAME for ChromaDB (e.g., asc_842)
Steps: a short list, e.g., 4–6 step names
Seed docs location (e.g., data/asc842/*)
Steps

Scaffold
Copy standards_template to asc842/ and replace placeholders
Create utils/asc842_step_prompts.py with your step prompts
Wire up the page
Import asc842_page in main/app and add to navigation
Knowledge base
Seed ChromaDB collection asc_842 from data/asc842/*
Sanity check: a quick search returns expected chunks
Test the flow
Upload test documents and go through steps
Confirm analysis uses the correct collection
Memo
Adjust memo headers/sections specific to the standard
Quality gates
No import errors, no broken UI
At least one end-to-end memo generated successfully
Quick read for prompt clarity and accuracy
What I’ll put into replit.md for you (a starter skeleton) You mentioned you want “repeatable instructions to Replit.” Here’s a simple structure I can tailor once I see your repo. You can copy-paste the below into your replit.md and we’ll refine with exact file names and commands.

Project purpose

Build repeatable ASC analysis tools using a common pattern (ASC 606 as the reference)
Architecture overview

Shared components: shared/document_processor.py, shared/knowledge_base.py, shared/ui_components.py, shared/memo_generator.py
Per-standard modules: ascXXX/page.py, ascXXX/step_analyzer.py, ascXXX/knowledge_search.py, utils/ascXXX_step_prompts.py
Knowledge base: one ChromaDB collection per standard (e.g., asc_606, asc_340_40)
Agent tasks: add a new standard

Scaffold
Copy standards_template → asc{{code}}/
Replace placeholders: {{STANDARD_CODE}}, {{DISPLAY_NAME}}, {{COLLECTION_NAME}}
Prompts
Create utils/{{code}}_step_prompts.py with defined step list and prompts
Routing
Register asc{{code}} page in main/app navigation
Knowledge base
Seed ChromaDB collection {{COLLECTION_NAME}} from data/{{code}}/*
Verify
Run the app, confirm page loads, RAG pulls from new collection
Generate a memo
Commit
Commit all changes
Commands

Seed KB: python scripts/seed_kb.py --collection {{COLLECTION_NAME}} --src data/{{code}}
Run app: <your run command here (e.g., streamlit run app.py)>
Quality gates

No import errors
Sanity check RAG returns relevant chunks
One test memo generated without errors
Naming conventions

Collection: asc_XXX (underscore for subtopics, e.g., asc_340_40)
Module: ascXXX/ (no dashes)
Prompts: utils/ascXXX_step_prompts.py
Optional: tiny scaffold script (to add later) After I see your repo structure, I can give you a 30–40 line Python script that:

Copies standards_template into ascXXX/
Replaces placeholders in filenames and file contents
Adds a nav entry in main/app
Prints next steps to seed the KB
Next step Send me the files listed above (even in chunks). With that, I’ll:

Point out exact import fixes and directory alignment to get ASC 340-40 working
Provide a small scaffold script customized to your repo
Draft a concrete replit.md you can keep using for every new standard
Give you a two-pass plan: ship 340-40 now, then a minimal base class refactor to make 842/718 even faster
We’ll keep this simple and repeatable so you can focus on accounting content, not plumbing.
