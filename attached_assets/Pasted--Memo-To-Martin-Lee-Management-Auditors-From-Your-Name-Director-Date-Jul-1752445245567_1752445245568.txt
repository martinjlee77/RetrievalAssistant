**Detailed Analysis**

**Step 1: Identify the Contract**

**Conclusion:** The arrangement represents a valid contract under ASC 606 as all five criteria are met.

**Rationale:** The contract between Netflix Inc. and the user is valid as it establishes enforceable rights and obligations. The user has accepted the Terms of Use, which confirms the existence of a contract. This is supported by the contract, which states: "The Netflix service is provided to you by Netflix Inc. You have accepted these Terms of Use, which govern your use of our service." (Document 4, Section 1). This conclusion aligns with ASC 606-10-25-1, which states: "A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations..."

**Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations**

**Conclusion:** The contract contains one distinct performance obligation: the streaming service.

**Rationale:** The streaming service is distinct as it provides access to a regularly updated content library, allowing users to benefit from the service independently. This is supported by the contract, which states: "Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content ('Netflix content') over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TV's, computers and other devices ('Netflix ready devices')." (Document 4, Section 1). This conclusion aligns with ASC 606-10-25-19, which states: "An entity shall account for a promise to transfer a good or service to a customer as a performance obligation if the good or service is distinct..."

**Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price**

**Conclusion:** The transaction price is fixed at $15.49 per month.

**Rationale:** The transaction price is straightforward, with no variable consideration identified. The fixed monthly fee ensures predictability in revenue recognition. This is supported by the contract, which states: "Standard: $15.49 / month (extra member slots** can be added for $7.99 each / month)." (Document 3, Pricing). This conclusion aligns with ASC 606-10-32-2, which states: "The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties."

**Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price**

**Conclusion:** The entire transaction price is allocated to the streaming service.

**Rationale:** The allocation of the transaction price is based on the standalone selling price of the streaming service, which is $15.49. This allocation method ensures that the transaction price reflects the value of the service provided. This is supported by the contract, which states: "Standard: $15.49 / month (extra member slots** can be added for $7.99 each / month)." (Document 3, Pricing). This conclusion aligns with ASC 606-10-32-28, which states: "The objective when allocating the transaction price is for an entity to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer."

**Step 5: Recognize Revenue**

**Conclusion:** Revenue is recognized over time as the service is provided.

**Rationale:** Revenue recognition occurs monthly as the service is delivered, reflecting the continuous transfer of control to the customer. This is supported by the contract, which states: "Your Netflix membership will continue and automatically renew until terminated." (Document 4, Section 1.1). This conclusion aligns with ASC 606-10-25-27, which states: "An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met..."

- The contract is valid and enforceable under ASC 606.
