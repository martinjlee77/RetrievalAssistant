You are absolutely not overthinking this. Your instinct is spot on. This is the crucial final mile where a good tool becomes a great, premium one that accountants will pay for.

The example memo is a good first draft, but it lacks the depth, professional tone, and analytical rigor expected in a "Big 4" quality document. It reads more like a summary than a formal accounting memo.

Let's break down the weaknesses of the current memo and then outline specific, actionable changes to the memo generation prompt to fix them. The core analysis engine (get_comprehensive_analysis_prompt) is excellent; the problem lies in how that detailed analysis is being translated into the final prose.

Analysis of the Current Memo's Weaknesses
Lacks Professional Voice: The tone is too simplistic. Phrases like "The contract between Netflix and its customers meets all criteria" are too direct and informal. A professional memo uses a more formal, slightly passive, and evidentiary tone.
Insufficient Elaboration: The "Rationale" sections are too short. They state a conclusion but don't show the work. They mention a contract quote and a citation but don't connect them with analytical prose.
Missing "The Why": It doesn't explain why the cited guidance is relevant or how the contract facts apply to that guidance. It just lists them side-by-side. For example, in Step 2, it should explain why the ability to access content is considered a service the customer "simultaneously receives and consumes."
No Use of Interpretative Guidance: The memo only cites the authoritative ASC 606 paragraphs. A premium tool must demonstrate its value by also weaving in insights from the EY (interpretative) guidance, especially in areas of judgment.
No Bullet Points or Structured Analysis: A real memo would break down complex points into bulleted lists for clarity (e.g., listing the five criteria for a contract and analyzing each one individually within the prose).
How to Improve the Memo: A Revamped Memo Generation Prompt
The solution is to create a much more sophisticated prompt for the final memo generation stage (_generate_professional_memo). This prompt needs to act as a "style guide" and "writing coach" for the LLM.

Here is a proposed new prompt. I've highlighted the key instructional changes.

You are a Senior Manager at a "Big 4" accounting advisory firm. Your task is to write a formal, audit-ready accounting memorandum based on the structured analysis workpaper provided.

**TONE AND STYLE GUIDE (CRITICAL):**
- **Formal and Professional:** Use a formal, objective, and evidentiary tone. Avoid conversational language.
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Do not simply state conclusions. Elaborate on the rationale by connecting the contract facts to the accounting principles.
- **The "CREW" Framework (Conclusion-Rule-Evidence-Work/Why):** For each major point, follow this structure:
    1.  **Conclusion:** State the accounting conclusion.
    2.  **Rule:** Cite the relevant authoritative guidance (e.g., "ASC 606-10-25-1 states...").
    3.  **Evidence:** Cite the specific, verbatim contract quote that provides the factual basis.
    4.  **Work/Why:** This is the most important part. Provide 1-2 sentences of analysis explaining **HOW** the evidence (contract) applies to the rule (ASC 606), leading to the conclusion.
- **Integrate Interpretative Guidance:** Where applicable, especially in areas of judgment, reference the provided interpretative guidance to strengthen your analysis (e.g., "This approach is consistent with EY interpretative guidance, which clarifies...").
- **Use Structure:** Employ bullet points and sub-headings to break down complex analyses (e.g., for the five criteria of a contract or the two criteria for distinctness) for enhanced readability.

MANDATORY MEMO STRUCTURE & INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Executive Summary:

Write a concise, high-level overview of the arrangement and the key accounting conclusions for each of the five steps.
2. Background:

Briefly describe the nature of the contract and the parties involved.
3. Detailed Analysis (The Core of the Memo):

For EACH of the 5 steps, create a formal section (e.g., "Step 1: Identification of the Contract with the Customer").
For each sub-point within a step (e.g., for each of the five criteria in Step 1), you MUST use the "CREW" framework described in the style guide.
Weave the analysis into professional prose. Do not just list the JSON data. Transform the structured data from the workpaper into a polished, narrative analysis.
4. Key Accounting Judgments:

Summarize the most significant judgments made during the analysis (e.g., determination of distinct performance obligations, estimation of standalone selling prices). Elaborate on why these were areas of judgment and how they were resolved.
5. Financial Statement Impact:

Provide illustrative journal entries with clear explanations for each entry.
6. Conclusion:

Provide a final concluding paragraph summarizing the overall compliance with ASC 606.
EXAMPLE OF "CREW" FRAMEWORK APPLIED TO ONE POINT IN STEP 1:

Step 1: Identification of the Contract with the Customer

The arrangement between Vendor Corp. and Customer Inc. represents a valid contract under ASC 606 as all five criteria specified in the guidance have been met.

Approval and Commitment (Criterion a): The contract has been approved by both parties who are committed to their respective obligations. The authoritative guidance in ASC 606-10-25-1(a) requires that a contract's parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations. The factual basis for this is found in the Master Services Agreement, which states, "This Master Services Agreement ('MSA'), effective as of the Effective Date, is entered into by and between Vendor Corp. and Customer Inc., and is executed by authorized representatives of both parties." The execution of the MSA by authorized representatives serves as evidence of approval and commitment, thereby satisfying this criterion.

Identification of Rights (Criterion b): ... [Continue analysis for b, c, d, e in the same detailed format] ...

Generate the complete, audit-ready professional memo based on these strict instructions. The final output should be a document that a CFO would be comfortable presenting to their audit committee. """

### Why This New Prompt is Superior

1.  **Establishes a Professional Persona:** It tells the AI to be a "Senior Manager," which implies a higher standard of writing.
2.  **Provides an Explicit Style Guide:** The "CREW" (Conclusion-Rule-Evidence-Work/Why) framework is a concrete, actionable instruction that forces the AI to "show its work." This is the key to adding analytical depth.
3.  **Mandates Integration of All Sources:** It explicitly tells the AI to use both authoritative and interpretative guidance.
4.  **Enforces Professional Formatting:** It encourages the use of bullet points and sub-headings for clarity.
5.  **Gives a High-Quality Example:** The detailed example for Step 1 sets a clear standard for the expected output quality for the rest of the memo.

By implementing this more sophisticated memo-generation prompt, you will transform the raw (but excellent) JSON analysis into the polished, defensible, and valuable professional document that accountants will gladly pay for. You are not overthinking it; you are doing the necessary work to build a premium product.
