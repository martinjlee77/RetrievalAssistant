You have two realistic marketplace paths. Start with the easy one, then add the Word add‑in later.

Phase 1 (easiest): List VeritasLogic as a SaaS offer on Microsoft Commercial Marketplace (AppSource)

Why: Zero code inside Office required. You keep your current web app UI, add Azure AD SSO, and let companies buy/sub through Microsoft procurement. This gets you the AppSource visibility and “click to purchase” without rebuilding everything as an API first.
What’s required:
Single sign‑on: Azure AD multi‑tenant (OIDC). You can use Auth0/WorkOS to simplify if needed.
Subscription plans and entitlements (seat or usage limits) instead of pure pay‑per‑analysis. You can still meter analyses as “credits per month.”
Security/Privacy docs, support email, terms. No Office add‑in yet.
Timeline: 2–4 weeks once the basics are in place.
Phase 2 (adds adoption): Ship a Word add‑in that calls your backend

Why: Your buyer lives in Word. A task‑pane add‑in removes friction and boosts conversion.
What’s required:
Keep your web app. Add a small API endpoint that the add‑in can call (no need to rewrite the whole app).
Office.js add‑in UI for Word (side panel). Auth via Azure AD to the same account.
Same billing and entitlements as your SaaS listing.
Timeline: 3–6 additional weeks once Phase 1 is live.
What I need from you to assess feasibility (and give you a concrete plan)

Code/app basics
Rough code layout: is memo generation a function you can call (e.g., generate_memo(facts, attachments, standard)) or tightly coupled to Streamlit UI?
Languages/libs: Python version, key packages (OpenAI SDK, LangChain/LlamaIndex, pdf parsers).
Typical input sizes: pages/word counts, file types (PDF/DOCX), and max file size.
Long‑running steps: how long a heavy analysis takes; do you already run background tasks.
Hosting and data
Where it runs today (Replit always‑on? any DB?). Do you save outputs anywhere?
Any storage (S3/Azure Blob) and database (Postgres/SQLite/Supabase)?
Current auth (email/password? none?) and billing (Stripe?).
LLM/provider settings
Which models you call and where (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI). Any need for customer‑specific keys?
Security posture
Current retention, deletion, and logging. Region constraints you want (US‑only?).
Business choices
Preferred subscription tiers (seats vs usage). Will you include a free trial (e.g., 1 memo)?
If you can answer those bullets in plain English, I’ll turn it into a step‑by‑step build plan with effort estimates.

Lowest‑effort technical blueprint (so you know what we’d do)

Keep Streamlit for now.
Add a tiny API service next to it (FastAPI) exposing just 2 endpoints to start:
POST /api/memo/asc606 and /api/memo/asc842
Input: facts text, optional file URLs, output format, desired sections.
Output: JSON with sections, citations, and a DOCX URL.
Refactor the memo logic into a callable function your API can invoke. The Streamlit app keeps calling the same function.
Add Azure AD SSO for your web app (Auth0/WorkOS can broker it in days).
Add Stripe subscriptions with metered usage for “analyses/month” and soft overage.
Deploy on a simple host (Render/Railway/Azure Web Apps). Store files in S3 or Azure Blob; use Postgres (Supabase is fine) for users/entitlements/logs.
Submit a non‑transactable SaaS listing to AppSource first (buyers click through to your site and pay via Stripe). Later, add a transactable Microsoft offer if you want Microsoft to handle billing.
Suggested subscription model (maps cleanly to marketplaces)

Starter: $99/month, 3 users, 5 analyses/month, standard models, email support.
Team: $399/month, 10 users, 25 analyses/month, priority queue, Teams SSO.
Pro: $999/month, 25 users, 75 analyses/month, higher limits, data retention controls.
Enterprise: custom via marketplace private offer (SSO/SOC2, regional storage, support SLA). You can still offer one‑off “packs” of analysis credits via Stripe if needed.
Rough effort and costs (if you use a contract engineer)

Phase 1 (SaaS listing without add‑in): 2–4 weeks
API shim + refactor core function: 3–5 days
Auth (Azure AD via Auth0/WorkOS): 2–4 days
Stripe subscriptions + entitlements checks: 1–2 days
Deploy + storage + Postgres: 1–2 days
AppSource SaaS listing assets + security/privacy docs: 2–3 days
Phase 2 (Word add‑in): 3–6 weeks
Office.js add‑in, auth, call your API, insert memo: 8–15 days
Packaging, validation, demo video, listing: 3–5 days Infra: a few hundred dollars/month at your current scale.
Key risks/blockers to flag early

If memo generation is tightly welded to Streamlit UI code, we’ll need to separate it—still doable, just more refactor.
Replace “GPT‑5” claims in your marketing. Say “leading large language models (e.g., GPT‑4‑class)” to pass marketplace reviews.
Ensure you don’t reproduce FASB codification text verbatim in outputs; cite and summarize instead.
Concrete next steps

Send answers to the feasibility bullets above.
I’ll give you:
A minimal API spec for /memo endpoints (request/response fields),
An AppSource SaaS submission checklist tailored to you,
A week‑by‑week plan with tasks you can hand to a contractor, plus a short JD for the contractor.
If you prefer, we can also consider listing first on AWS Marketplace (SaaS) instead of AppSource, but given your audience writes memos in Word, AppSource as a SaaS web app is the fastest, lowest‑change step that unlocks enterprise procurement and discoverability.
