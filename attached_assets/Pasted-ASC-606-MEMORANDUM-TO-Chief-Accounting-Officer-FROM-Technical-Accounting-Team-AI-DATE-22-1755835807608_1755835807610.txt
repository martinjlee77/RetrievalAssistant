RE: contract01 - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The analysis of the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee confirms compliance with ASC 606, as all criteria under ASC 606-10-25-1 are met. The contract has a single performance obligation, which is the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" subscription service. This service is distinct and independently usable, aligning with the requirements for identifying performance obligations.

The transaction price is fixed at $119.88, with no variable considerations or other adjustments, ensuring straightforward allocation. The entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation, following the relative standalone selling price methodology. This allocation process is simplified by the absence of discounts or additional complexities.

Revenue recognition will occur over time, with the $119.88 being recognized on a straight-line basis at $9.99 per month from July 2025 to July 2026. This approach reflects the continuous delivery of service benefits to the customer throughout the contract term. No significant issues were identified, affirming the contract's adherence to ASC 606 standards.

BACKGROUND
The arrangement reviewed involves a subscription service contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, specifically for the provision of a "Photography plan (20GB)" under a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The contract analysis under ASC 606 focuses on ensuring the proper identification and recognition of revenue associated with the single performance obligation inherent in the subscription service. This analysis aims to ensure compliance with ASC 606 revenue recognition standards, providing clarity on the allocation and timing of revenue recognition over the service period.

ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Analysis:

To determine if a valid contract exists under ASC 606, we must evaluate the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee against the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1.

1. Approval and Commitment (ASC 606-10-25-1(a)): The contract is evidenced by an invoice dated July 9, 2025, which indicates that Adobe Inc. has issued a formal billing document to Martin Lee. This suggests that both parties have approved the contract and are committed to performing their respective obligations. The issuance of an invoice typically signifies mutual agreement and commitment to the terms outlined therein.

2. Identification of Rights (ASC 606-10-25-1(b)): The contract clearly identifies the rights of each party. Adobe Inc. is obligated to provide a "Photography plan (20GB)" service to Martin Lee for the term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. Martin Lee, as the customer, has the right to access and use this service during the specified term.

3. Payment Terms (ASC 606-10-25-1(c)): The payment terms are explicitly stated in the invoice. The total amount due is $127.82, which includes a net amount of $119.88 and taxes of $7.94. The payment is to be made via credit card, indicating clear terms for the consideration to be exchanged for the services provided.

4. Commercial Substance (ASC 606-10-25-1(d)): The contract has commercial substance because it is expected to change the risk, timing, or amount of Adobe Inc.'s future cash flows. The receipt of $127.82 from Martin Lee for the service provided will impact Adobe Inc.'s financial position, thereby meeting the commercial substance criterion.

5. Probability of Collection (ASC 606-10-25-1(e)): It is probable that Adobe Inc. will collect the consideration due, as the payment terms specify the use of a credit card, which generally ensures a higher likelihood of collection. Additionally, Adobe's standard business practices, as outlined in the subscription terms, include measures to ensure payment, such as automatic renewal and backup payment methods.

Conclusion: The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee meets all the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1. The parties have approved the contract, identified their respective rights and payment terms, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that Adobe Inc. will collect the consideration due.

Issues or Uncertainties: None identified.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Analysis:

The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee involves the provision of a "Photography plan (20GB)" for a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-25-14, the first step in identifying performance obligations is to assess the goods or services promised in the contract. The contract promises a subscription service for a photography plan, which includes cloud storage and potentially access to Adobe's software and services.

To determine if the promised service is distinct, we refer to ASC 606-10-25-20, which states that a good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or with other readily available resources. The photography plan is capable of being distinct because Martin Lee can benefit from the cloud storage and software access independently, as these services are typically sold separately and can be used with other resources, such as a personal computer or camera.

Further, under ASC 606-10-25-21, we evaluate whether the service is distinct within the context of the contract. The photography plan is regularly sold separately, as evidenced by Adobe's standard offerings. Martin Lee can benefit from the service on its own, and the service is not highly interdependent with other promises in the contract, as there are no additional bundled services or goods mentioned.

Since the photography plan meets the criteria for being distinct, it is identified as a separate performance obligation. There are no indications of third-party involvement that would necessitate a principal versus agent determination under ASC 606-10-25-75 to 25-79. Additionally, the contract does not provide options for additional goods or services or material rights that would require separate consideration under ASC 606-10-25-20.

Conclusion:

The contract with Martin Lee includes a single performance obligation: the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" subscription service. This service is distinct because it is capable of being used independently and is not interdependent with other services or goods in the contract.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In analyzing the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, the transaction price must be determined in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-2. The contract specifies a fixed consideration amount of $119.88 for the Photography Plan (20GB) service, which is provided over a one-year term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. This fixed amount is clearly stated in the invoice and does not include any variable consideration components, as there are no indications of discounts, rebates, or performance bonuses that could affect the transaction price.

The invoice also includes a tax amount of $7.94, calculated at a rate of 6.63%, bringing the total invoice amount to $127.82. However, taxes are not considered part of the transaction price under ASC 606, as they are collected on behalf of governmental authorities.

There is no evidence of variable consideration in this contract, as the terms do not mention any contingent payments or returns that would require estimation and constraint evaluation under ASC 606-10-32-11 through 32-14. The transaction price is therefore solely based on the fixed consideration.

Regarding significant financing components, ASC 606-10-32-15 requires consideration of whether the timing of payments provides a significant benefit of financing. In this case, the payment terms are via credit card, and there is no indication of deferred payment or advance payment that would necessitate an adjustment for the time value of money. Thus, no significant financing component is present.

The contract does not involve noncash consideration, as the payment is made in USD, nor is there any consideration paid or payable to the customer that would affect the transaction price.

Conclusion:

The transaction price for the contract with Martin Lee is determined to be $119.88, based solely on the fixed consideration for the Photography Plan service. There are no variable considerations, significant financing components, noncash considerations, or customer payables affecting the transaction price.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In the contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee, the primary performance obligation identified is the provision of the "Photography plan (20GB)" service for a term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-32-31, the standalone selling prices (SSPs) for each performance obligation should be determined separately based on observable data. This involves identifying the price at which Adobe Inc. would sell the service separately to a customer under similar circumstances.

The allocation of the transaction price should be proportional to the SSPs of the identified performance obligations. In this case, since there is only one performance obligation, the entire transaction price of $119.88 (excluding taxes) is allocated to the "Photography plan (20GB)" service. ASC 606-10-32-29 emphasizes that the transaction price should be allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.

Regarding discount allocation, ASC 606-10-32-36 states that if a discount is applicable, it should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless it is specifically attributable to one or more, but not all, performance obligations. In this contract, there is no explicit discount mentioned, so the full transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.

The final allocation approach, subject to the determination of SSPs, involves assigning the entire transaction price of $119.88 to the "Photography plan (20GB)" service, as it is the sole performance obligation in the contract.

Conclusion:

The transaction price of $119.88 is allocated entirely to the "Photography plan (20GB)" service, as it is the only performance obligation identified. The allocation is based on the relative standalone selling price methodology as per ASC 606 guidelines. No discounts are applicable in this contract, simplifying the allocation process.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Analysis:

The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee involves a subscription service for a "Photography plan (20GB)" with a service term from July 9, 2025, to July 8, 2026. According to ASC 606-10-25-23, revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. In this case, the performance obligation is the provision of access to Adobe's photography plan over the specified service term.

The nature of the service suggests that revenue should be recognized over time. This is because Martin Lee, the customer, simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service as Adobe performs, aligning with ASC 606-10-25-27(a). The service is continuous, and the customer benefits from the service throughout the subscription period, indicating that control transfers over time rather than at a single point in time.

For over-time recognition, ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29 requires measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Adobe can use a time-based measure, such as a straight-line basis, to recognize revenue evenly over the 12-month service term. This method is appropriate because the service is provided consistently throughout the period, and the customer receives equal benefit each month.

The invoice indicates a total net amount of $119.88 for the service, with taxes amounting to $7.94, leading to a grand total of $127.82. Revenue recognition should be based on the net amount of $119.88, allocated evenly over the 12-month period, resulting in monthly revenue recognition of $9.99 ($119.88 / 12 months).

Conclusion:

Revenue for the Adobe Photography plan should be recognized over time on a straight-line basis, as the customer receives and consumes the benefits continuously over the service term. The total net amount of $119.88 will be recognized as revenue at $9.99 per month from July 2025 to July 2026.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

CONCLUSION
The contract between Adobe Inc. and Martin Lee is fully compliant with ASC 606, as it satisfies all the criteria for contract existence, performance obligations, and transaction price determination. The transaction price of $119.88 is appropriately allocated to the single performance obligation, and revenue recognition is correctly scheduled on a straight-line basis over the service term, ensuring adherence to the revenue recognition principle. There are no concerns regarding the application of ASC 606 in this analysis, as all steps have been meticulously followed and documented.
