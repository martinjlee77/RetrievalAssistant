Here’s a consolidated package you can hand to your developer. It covers product positioning, packaging, pricing, rerun policy, implementation details, and updated website copy (HTML sections you can paste in). It’s organized so you can pick up each part independently.

Packaging and pricing (final spec)
Positioning

Who it’s for: Public-company and large private technical accounting teams that need audit-ready draft memos fast.
What it delivers: A complete, Big 4–style technical memo (ASC paragraph citations, executive summary, background, analysis, conclusion). Optional human review by an ex–EY partner.
Pricing model: Per-analysis. Same features in every tier. Tiers differ only by input length and allowed number of documents.
Tiers (length-based, same benefits)

15K (≤50 pages)
Price: $395
Max words: 15,000
Docs per run: up to 5
Reruns included: 1 within 14 days (same doc set; minor edits allowed)
30K (≤100 pages)
Price: $695
Max words: 30,000
Docs per run: up to 7
Reruns included: 1 within 14 days (same doc set; minor edits allowed)
60K (≤200 pages)
Price: $1,195
Max words: 60,000
Docs per run: up to 10
Reruns included: 1 within 14 days (same doc set; minor edits allowed)
What’s included in every tier

Up to N documents per run (per tier above)
Full memo with paragraph-level ASC citations, executive summary, background, analysis, and conclusion
1 complimentary rerun within 14 days (same document set; minor edits allowed)
Email support with same business-day target response
Audit Pack export (citations list + assumptions/judgments + references)
Add-ons

Rush processing: +$150 (priority queue)
Human review by ex–EY partner: $300/hour (sell in 1h, 3h, 6h blocks; no discounts)
Trial and trust

First Memo Credit: $200 off your first paid memo (any tier)
Money-back guarantee: If your first paid memo is unusable for the stated purpose, we’ll refund it
Founding Customer Pricing note

Label the current list prices as “Founding Customer Pricing” for the first 20–30 customer companies. This is a positioning device, not necessarily a discount. In exchange, request permission to use logo and a short testimonial (optional).
Rerun policy (public-facing copy)
Reruns included

Each analysis includes 1 complimentary rerun within 14 days of the original run.
Reruns are intended for minor adjustments, formatting refinements, or clarifications.
What qualifies as a rerun

Same document set with minor edits (generally ≤10% changes in total word count).
Same scope and standard. If the contract set or scope changes materially, it’s a new analysis.
How to request a rerun

Re-upload your documents, select “This is a rerun,” and include your original memo ID in the notes.
Describe what you want adjusted (e.g., emphasize specific clauses, clarify conclusions, adjust tone).
What’s not covered

Major scope changes, new or additional contracts, or different standards require a new analysis.
Rerun window expires after 14 days.

constraints JSON (e.g., must reference parent_run_id; must be same tier; only within 14 days)
Rerun flow (Phase 1: coupon-based)

UI changes:
Add a checkbox: “This is a rerun”
Text input: “Original memo ID” (free text)
Text area: “What should we adjust?”
Server logic:
If “rerun” checked:
Validate original memo ID belongs to user.
Check original run reruns_used < reruns_included and now < rerun_expiry.
Compute current docset_hash and compare to original; allow if “minor edits” threshold is met (e.g., within 10% total word count delta OR heuristic comparing combined file sizes).
Generate a one-time RERUN_100 coupon (100% off) tied to parent_run_id and this user.
Process normally; set parent_run_id to original; increment reruns_used on parent.
Prompting:
Prepend a rerun note to the system or developer prompt:
Include original memo ID, key sections (or a short summary), and user change notes.
“Treat this as a refinement of the original analysis; maintain structure and citations.”
Word and page estimation

Word count: compute from extracted text. If OCR needed, do OCR first; if extraction fails, estimate pages × 300 words/page.
Pre-check:
Show estimated words and tier suggestion before payment.
If over cap, automatically propose next tier. Do not do overages.
Upload limits

Set a per-run size cap (e.g., 150 MB total).
Allowed file types: PDF, DOCX, TXT (and images if OCR included).
Doc count per tier as above (5/7/10), but you can globally cap to 5 if needed initially.
Queueing and rate limits

Start with 1–2 concurrent analyses per org/user; increase later.
Implement retry with exponential backoff on model calls.
Batch embeddings/OCR to smooth spikes.
Audit Pack export

Build a simple export payload:
Citations (ASC references with paragraph numbers)
Key assumptions and judgments
References list (source docs)
Provide downloadable PDF (and optionally a ZIP containing a JSON of the same for internal audit systems).
Metrics to log

Acceptance rate at list price
Tier mix (15K vs 30K vs 60K)
Rerun request rate and pass/fail against policy
% taking human review and average hours purchased
Average tokens per run (ingest, retrieve, draft, verify) to confirm margin
First Memo Credit logic

On first paid run for a new organization, auto-offer a FIRST_MEMO_200 coupon at checkout. Expire 30–60 days from sign-up.

Pilot/offer line

Founding Customer Pricing for early adopters. $200 off your first memo with code FIRST200. Money-back guarantee on your first memo if it’s unusable for the stated purpose.
Notes on context and scalability (internal)
Even at 60K words, you should not push model context if you keep your staged pipeline: chunk → retrieve top‑K → section summaries → final draft from structured notes. Keep final prompts within the model’s context window. Monitor token usage; request higher API rate limits if you experience quarter‑end spikes.
Start with a single concurrency slot per org during launch, raise when stable.
If you want, I can also produce a one-page “Pricing & Rerun Policy” PDF copy for legal/terms, or draft your in‑app checkout microcopy (tier selector, estimator tooltip, rerun checkbox label, and coupon field labels).
