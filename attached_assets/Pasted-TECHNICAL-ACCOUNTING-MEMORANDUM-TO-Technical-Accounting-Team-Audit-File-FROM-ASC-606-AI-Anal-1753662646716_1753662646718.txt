# Memo
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The analysis of the contract between Netflix and Martin Lee concludes that the agreement meets all criteria for revenue recognition under ASC 606. The contract is valid, with a transaction price of $15.49 allocated entirely to a single performance obligation: the provision of streaming services. Revenue will be recognized over the subscription period as control is transferred continuously. Key judgments include the determination of the contract's enforceability, the distinct nature of the performance obligation, and the absence of variable considerations. Overall, the treatment of this contract aligns with ASC 606 guidelines, ensuring compliance and proper revenue recognition.
2. 2. BACKGROUND
The parties involved in this contract are Netflix and the customer, Martin Lee. The service period for the subscription is from September 26, 2024, to October 25, 2024. This analysis aims to evaluate the revenue recognition implications of the Netflix subscription service under ASC 606, focusing on the identification of the contract, performance obligations, transaction price, allocation of the transaction price, and revenue recognition. Unique circumstances include the straightforward nature of the subscription service and the absence of variable pricing or bundled services, which simplifies the analysis.
3. 3. DETAILED ANALYSIS
4. STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT
- **Executive Conclusion**: The contract between Netflix and Martin Lee meets all five criteria under ASC 606-10-25-1, establishing it as a valid contract for revenue recognition purposes.
- **Detailed Analysis**: The first step in ASC 606 requires identifying whether a contract exists. According to ASC 606-10-25-1, a contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. The contract must meet five criteria: approval and commitment, identification of rights, payment terms, commercial substance, and collectibility.
Firstly, the contract must be approved, and the parties must be committed to their obligations. The Netflix Terms of Use, as provided, indicate that Martin Lee has accepted the terms, which is evidenced by the payment and the service period outlined in the invoice. [QUOTE]“You have accepted these Terms of Use, which govern your use of our service.”[/QUOTE] This demonstrates mutual approval and commitment.
Secondly, the contract must identify the rights of the parties. The Terms of Use clearly outline the rights of Martin Lee to access Netflix content during the subscription period, and Netflix's right to receive payment. [QUOTE]“Your Netflix membership will continue and automatically renew until terminated.”[/QUOTE] This clause specifies the rights and obligations of both parties.
Thirdly, the payment terms must be identified. The invoice specifies the amount due and the payment method, indicating clear payment terms. [QUOTE]“The subscription fee for the Netflix service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the 'Account' page.”[/QUOTE] This provides clarity on how and when payments are to be made.
Fourthly, the contract must have commercial substance. The exchange of payment for access to Netflix services indicates that the contract has commercial substance, as it impacts the cash flows of both parties.
Finally, collectibility must be probable. Given that the payment has been successfully processed, as evidenced by the invoice and payment history, collectibility is deemed probable.
In conclusion, the contract between Netflix and Martin Lee satisfies all the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-1, making it a valid contract for revenue recognition purposes.

•	**Supporting Contract Evidence**:
•	[QUOTE]“Your Netflix membership will continue and automatically renew until terminated.”[/QUOTE]: This indicates ongoing approval and commitment from both parties, satisfying one of the key criteria for contract identification.
•	[QUOTE]“The subscription fee for the Netflix service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the 'Account' page.”[/QUOTE]: This specifies the payment terms, providing clarity on how and when payments are to be made, fulfilling another criterion.
•	**Professional Judgments**: The analysis required assessing the enforceability of the contract terms and the probability of collectibility. Given the successful payment, collectibility is deemed probable. The commitment of both parties is evidenced by the acceptance of Terms of Use and the payment history.
•	**Potential Issues Addressed**: Potential issues such as the customer's creditworthiness and the enforceability of the contract under applicable law were considered. The successful payment and clear terms mitigate these concerns. Additionally, no contract modifications were identified, simplifying the analysis.
5. STEP 2: IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
- **Executive Conclusion**: The Netflix streaming service subscription constitutes a single performance obligation, as the service is both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract, supported by ASC 606 guidance and contract analysis.
- **Detailed Analysis**: In analyzing the Netflix contract under ASC 606 Step 2, we must determine whether the streaming service subscription constitutes a distinct performance obligation. According to [CITATION]ASC 606-10-25-19: 'A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: (a) The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct); and (b) The entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).'[/CITATION], the Netflix streaming service is capable of being distinct because customers can benefit from it on its own, as it provides access to a library of content that can be consumed independently of other services or products. This capability is evident from the contract's description of the service as a standalone subscription that provides access to Netflix content over the Internet on compatible devices.
Furthermore, the service is distinct within the context of the contract. The Netflix contract does not bundle the streaming service with other goods or services that would necessitate a combined performance obligation. The contract's terms, as quoted, indicate that the service is provided on a monthly subscription basis, with no mention of additional bundled services or products that would require integration or interdependency. This aligns with [CITATION]ASC 606-10-25-21: 'Factors that indicate that an entity’s promise to transfer a good or service to a customer is separately identifiable (in accordance with paragraph 606-10-25-19(b)) include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) The entity does not provide a significant service of integrating the good or service with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output for which the customer has contracted.'[/CITATION].
The contract text [QUOTE]'Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content (“Netflix content”) over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TV’s, computers and other devices (“Netflix ready devices”).'[/QUOTE] supports the conclusion that the service is a distinct performance obligation. This language indicates that the service is self-contained and does not require additional components to deliver its intended benefit to the customer. Additionally, the contract specifies that the service is billed on a monthly basis, reinforcing the notion that each billing cycle represents a distinct period of service delivery.
In considering potential counterarguments, one might suggest that the ability to add extra members or the availability of different subscription tiers could imply bundled services. However, these are merely variations in service level rather than distinct goods or services, as they do not alter the fundamental nature of the streaming service provided. The different tiers and additional member options are pricing strategies rather than separate performance obligations, as they all relate to the same core service of streaming content.
