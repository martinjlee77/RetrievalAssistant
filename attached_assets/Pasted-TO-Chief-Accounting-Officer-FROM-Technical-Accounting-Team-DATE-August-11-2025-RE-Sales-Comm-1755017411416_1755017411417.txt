RE: Sales Comm 01
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This memorandum establishes the accounting policy for the recognition and amortization of sales commissions related to new customer contracts under ASC 340-40. The policy confirms that the 5% sales commission for new customer acquisitions, as outlined in the VeritasLogic FY2024 Sales Commission Plan, qualifies as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. This cost is to be capitalized and amortized over the initial contract term, aligning with the revenue recognition period for the related goods and services.
1.	SCOPE ASSESSMENT
The 5% sales commission described in the FY2024 Sales Commission Plan is within the scope of ASC 340-40 as it represents an incremental cost of obtaining a contract with a customer. The commission is triggered by a "Commissionable Event," defined as a fully executed customer contract for a new logo (new customer) acquisition. This aligns with ASC 340-40-15-2, which applies to costs directly attributable to securing a contract.
2.	COST CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK
Under ASC 340-40, the 5% sales commission is classified as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. The commission is directly attributable to the acquisition of a new customer contract and meets the criteria for capitalization. The commission is calculated as a flat rate of 5% of the Total Contract Value (TCV) and is paid within ninety (90) days following the end of the calendar month in which the Commissionable Event occurred.
3.	MEASUREMENT & AMORTIZATION POLICY
The commission costs are to be capitalized as an asset and amortized over the initial contract term. The TCV includes recurring software fees, one-time license fees, and professional services fees for the initial contract term. According to ASC 340-40-35-1, amortization should align with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Therefore, commissions will be amortized over the period in which the related revenue is recognized.
4.	ILLUSTRATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT
For a contract with a TCV of $100,000, the commission earned is $5,000 (5% of TCV). This commission cost is capitalized as a contract cost asset and amortized over 36 months, impacting both the balance sheet and income statement. The journal entry to record this would be:
•	Debit "Contract Cost Asset" $5,000
•	Credit "Cash/Accounts Payable" $5,000
CONCLUSION
The policy framework for VeritasLogic's sales commissions ensures compliance with ASC 340-40 by recognizing and amortizing commission costs over the initial contract term. This approach provides consistency in financial reporting and aligns with the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Implementation of this policy requires careful tracking of contract terms and conditions to ensure accurate capitalization and amortization of commission costs.
