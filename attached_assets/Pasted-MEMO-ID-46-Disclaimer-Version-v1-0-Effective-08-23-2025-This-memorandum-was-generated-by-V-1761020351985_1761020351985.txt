RE: Contract Analysis - ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis

DOCUMENTS REVIEWED: gemini_sow.docx

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The ASC 606 revenue recognition analysis for the Customer's contract confirms compliance with the standard's criteria, as the contract is valid under ASC 606-10-25-1. However, management must further assess the collectibility of consideration to ensure full compliance with ASC 606-10-25-1(e).

The contract encompasses three distinct performance obligations: the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, Hardware Provisioning, and Professional Services. These obligations are independently beneficial and separately identifiable, with a total fixed transaction price of $845,000. This includes $720,000 for the SaaS license, $50,000 for hardware, and $75,000 for professional services, with a 10% discount applied. Additionally, a variable consideration of $30,000 is contingent upon achieving specific performance metrics, requiring management's evaluation.

Revenue recognition for the SaaS license will occur over a 36-month period, while hardware and professional services revenue will be recognized upon delivery and acceptance, respectively. The allocation of the transaction price is based on the relative standalone selling prices (SSPs), ensuring the bundle discount is appropriately distributed. The performance bonus is treated as variable consideration, necessitating a probability assessment by management for inclusion in the transaction price.

BACKGROUND
The arrangement under review involves a comprehensive contract between the Customer and the Company, encompassing a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) license, hardware provisioning, and professional services. The analysis under ASC 606 aims to ensure proper identification and allocation of distinct performance obligations, assessment of variable considerations, and appropriate revenue recognition timing. This evaluation is essential for aligning the contract's financial reporting with the revenue recognition standards outlined in ASC 606.

ASC 606 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Identify the Contract
Analysis:

The contract between the Company and the Customer is analyzed to determine if it meets the criteria for a valid contract under ASC 606-10-25-1.

1. Scope of ASC 606: The arrangement involves the provision of software, hardware, and professional services, which are within the scope of ASC 606 as they do not fall under leases, insurance, financial instruments, or collaborations [ASC 606-10-15-2 to 15-5].

2. Contract Approval and Commitment: The contract is evidenced by a Statement of Work (SOW) dated October 26, 2023, under the terms of a Master Services Agreement from January 15, 2022. This indicates that both parties have approved the contract and are committed to performing their respective obligations [Contract, Effective Date].

3. Identification of Rights: The contract clearly identifies the rights of each party regarding the goods and services. The Company is obligated to provide the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license, OptiScan-7 scanners, and professional services. The Customer has the right to these goods and services as outlined in the project scope and deliverables [Contract, Project Scope and Deliverables].

4. Payment Terms: Payment terms are explicitly stated. The SaaS license is $240,000 per year, with the first year's fee due Net 30 from the Effective Date. The hardware and professional services each have a one-time fee of $50,000 and $75,000, respectively, also due Net 30 from the Effective Date [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule].

5. Commercial Substance: The contract has commercial substance as it changes the Company's future cash flows through the receipt of payments for the SaaS license, hardware, and services [ASC 606-10-25-1(d)].

6. Collectibility: The contract requires an assessment of whether it is probable that the Company will collect substantially all of the consideration. This involves evaluating the Customer's ability and intention to pay, which requires external information and management's judgment [ASC 606-10-25-1(e)]. This assessment is beyond the scope of this analysis and should be performed by management.

If any of the criteria in ASC 606-10-25-1 are not met, the guidance in ASC 606-10-25-6 to 25-8 should be applied to defer revenue recognition and recognize a liability. Additionally, if there are modifications to the contract, ASC 606-10-25-10 to 25-13 should be considered to determine if the modification constitutes a new contract or an extension of the existing one.

Conclusion:

The contract meets the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-1 for a valid contract, as it is within the scope of ASC 606, has been approved by both parties, identifies each party's rights and payment terms, and has commercial substance. However, the collectibility of consideration requires further assessment by management [ASC 606-10-25-1(e)].

Issues or Uncertainties:

The primary uncertainty is the assessment of collectibility, which requires external information about the Customer's creditworthiness and payment intentions. Management must perform this evaluation to ensure compliance with ASC 606-10-25-1(e).

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Analysis:

In analyzing the contract between the Company and the Customer, several distinct goods and services are promised, which must be evaluated under ASC 606 to determine if they constitute separate performance obligations.

1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License: The contract provides a 3-year subscription license for the Logi-AI Suite, including standard support and maintenance with monthly feature updates [Contract, 1.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License]. Under ASC 606-10-25-19, a good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or with other readily available resources. The SaaS license is capable of being distinct because the Customer can benefit from the software independently. The standard support and maintenance are also distinct as they do not significantly integrate or modify the software, and thus, they are separately identifiable [ASC 606-10-25-21(a-c)].

2. Hardware Provisioning: The Company will deliver 200 OptiScan-7 scanners, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery [Contract, 1.2 Hardware Provisioning]. The hardware is distinct because the Customer can use the scanners independently of other contract elements. The scanners do not require significant integration or customization with the SaaS, making them separately identifiable [ASC 606-10-25-21(a-c)].

3. Professional Services: These services include implementation, system integration, and on-site training, which enhance the functionality of the Logi-AI Suite by connecting it to the Customer's ERP system [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services]. Although the software can be used without these services, the integration significantly enhances its functionality, suggesting a high degree of interdependence. However, since the services are complete upon acceptance and do not modify the software itself, they are distinct within the context of the contract [ASC 606-10-25-21(b)].

4. Performance Bonus: The contract includes a performance bonus contingent upon achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs [Contract, 2.4 Performance Bonus]. This is a variable consideration element rather than a distinct performance obligation, as it depends on the outcome of using the other deliverables.

5. Bundle Discount: The contract provides a 10% discount on hardware and services, but not on the SaaS license [Contract, 2.5 Bundle Discount]. This discount affects the transaction price allocation but does not constitute a separate performance obligation.

The contract does not specify any warranty terms, so no separate performance obligation for warranties is identified. Additionally, there are no customer options for additional goods or services or material rights that would require separate consideration.

Conclusion:

We conclude that the contract includes three distinct performance obligations: (1) the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, (2) the Hardware Provisioning, and (3) the Professional Services. Each is distinct because the Customer can benefit from them independently, and they are separately identifiable within the contract context [ASC 606-10-25-19, ASC 606-10-25-21]. The performance bonus is a variable consideration element, not a separate performance obligation.

Issues or Uncertainties:

None identified.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In determining the transaction price under ASC 606, we must consider both fixed and variable consideration, as well as any significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer.

Fixed Consideration:

The contract specifies fixed consideration amounts for each component of the deliverables. The Logi-AI Suite SaaS License is priced at $240,000 per year, totaling $720,000 over the three-year term [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule]. The hardware, consisting of 200 OptiScan-7 scanners, is priced at a one-time fee of $50,000 [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule]. Professional services are also priced at a one-time fee of $75,000 [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule].

Variable Consideration:

The contract includes a performance bonus of $30,000, contingent upon the Customer achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs within the first 12 months [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule]. According to ASC 606-10-32-5 to 32-9, variable consideration must be estimated and included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Given the Company's history of achieving this metric with 80% of similar customers, it is likely that some portion of this bonus could be included in the transaction price. However, the exact probability and amount require management's judgment and evaluation [Management Input Required: Variable consideration estimate per ASC 606-10-32-11 to 32-13].

Bundle Discount:

The contract states a 10% discount on hardware and services, which needs to be allocated to the respective components based on their standalone selling prices (SSP) [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule]. This allocation requires management's determination of the SSP for each component [Management Input Required: SSP determination per ASC 606-10-32-33].

Significant Financing Components:

The payment terms for the SaaS license, hardware, and professional services are due within 30 days of the Effective Date, with subsequent annual payments for the SaaS license due at the beginning of each contract year [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule]. According to ASC 606-10-32-15, a significant financing component is not present as the payment terms do not provide a significant benefit of financing to either party.

Noncash Consideration:

There is no indication of noncash consideration in the contract.

Consideration Payable to a Customer:

There is no consideration payable to the customer identified in the contract.

Conclusion:

The total fixed transaction price is $845,000, comprising $720,000 for the SaaS license, $50,000 for hardware, and $75,000 for professional services, subject to allocation of the 10% discount. The variable consideration of $30,000 is subject to management's evaluation of the likelihood of achieving the performance metric [ASC 606-10-32-5]. No significant financing components or noncash consideration are present.

Issues or Uncertainties:

Management evaluation is required to estimate the variable consideration and determine the SSP for discount allocation.
The probability of achieving the performance bonus needs to be assessed to include it in the transaction price.
Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Analysis:

In this contract, the Company has identified three primary performance obligations: the provision of the Logi-AI Suite SaaS License, the delivery of OptiScan-7 hardware, and the execution of professional services for system integration and training. These obligations are distinct as they each provide separate benefits to the Customer and can be utilized independently or in conjunction with existing systems [Contract, Project Scope and Deliverables].

The standalone selling prices (SSPs) for these performance obligations must be determined by management based on observable data, as required by ASC 606-10-32-31 to 32-34. The contract explicitly states that the SaaS license is priced at its standard standalone rate, while the hardware and services include a 10% bundle discount [Contract, Fees and Payment Schedule].

To allocate the transaction price, ASC 606 allows for several methodologies, including the adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and residual approach [ASC 606-10-32-24]. Given the presence of a bundle discount, the discount should be allocated proportionately across the hardware and services based on their relative standalone selling prices, as per ASC 606-10-32-36. This ensures that the allocation reflects the relative value of each performance obligation.

The Company is also eligible for a performance bonus contingent upon the Customer achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs. This bonus represents variable consideration and should be included in the transaction price allocation if it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur [ASC 606-10-32-11].

Conclusion:

We conclude that the transaction price should be allocated to each performance obligation based on their relative SSPs, with the bundle discount proportionately distributed across the hardware and services. The SaaS license is priced at its standalone rate, while the performance bonus should be considered as variable consideration [ASC 606-10-32-31; ASC 606-10-32-36].

Issues or Uncertainties:

[Management Input Required: SSP determination per ASC 606-10-32-33]
The likelihood of achieving the performance bonus must be assessed to determine its inclusion in the transaction price.
Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Analysis:

The contract between the Company and the Customer involves multiple performance obligations, each requiring distinct revenue recognition analysis under ASC 606.

1. Logi-AI Suite SaaS License:

The SaaS license is a subscription service for a 3-year period, granting access to the Logi-AI Suite for up to 500 users, with standard support and maintenance. According to ASC 606-10-25-27, revenue is recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs. The SaaS license fits this criterion because the Customer receives continuous access and updates over the subscription term. Therefore, revenue should be recognized ratably over the 36-month term [Contract, 1.1 Logi-AI Suite SaaS License].
2. Hardware Provisioning (OptiScan-7 Scanners):

The contract specifies a one-time delivery of 200 scanners, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery. Under ASC 606-10-25-30, control is transferred at a point in time when the customer gains physical possession and legal title. Therefore, revenue for the $50,000 hardware fee is recognized at the point of delivery [Contract, 1.2 Hardware Provisioning].
3. Professional Services:

The professional services include implementation, system integration, and training, which enhance the functionality of the Logi-AI Suite. These services are considered complete upon the Customer's written acceptance. According to ASC 606-10-25-30, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer accepts the service completion. Therefore, the $75,000 fee is recognized upon acceptance [Contract, 1.3 Professional Services].
4. Performance Bonus:

The performance bonus is contingent upon achieving a 15% reduction in shipping costs within the first 12 months. ASC 606-10-32-5 requires that variable consideration be included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Given the Company's history of achieving this metric with 80% of similar customers, management must assess the likelihood of achieving the bonus [Contract, 2.4 Performance Bonus; Management Input Required: Probability assessment per ASC 606-10-32-5].
5. Bundle Discount:

The contract includes a 10% discount on hardware and services, but not on the SaaS license. ASC 606-10-32-33 requires allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on standalone selling prices (SSP). Management must determine the SSP for each component to allocate the discount appropriately [Contract, 2.5 Bundle Discount; Management Input Required: SSP determination per ASC 606-10-32-33].
Conclusion:

Revenue for the SaaS license is recognized over the 36-month term, while revenue for hardware and professional services is recognized at the point of delivery and acceptance, respectively. The performance bonus requires management's probability assessment for inclusion in the transaction price. The bundle discount necessitates SSP determination for proper allocation [ASC 606-10-25-27, ASC 606-10-25-30, ASC 606-10-32-5, ASC 606-10-32-33].

Issues or Uncertainties:

**SSP Determination:** Management must determine the standalone selling prices for each performance obligation to allocate the bundle discount [Management Input Required].
**Performance Bonus Probability:** Management needs to assess the likelihood of achieving the performance bonus to determine its inclusion in the transaction price [Management Input Required].
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the analysis of the contract indicates that it is accounted for properly under ASC 606 compliance. The contract meets the criteria for a valid contract, identifies three distinct performance obligations, and establishes a clear transaction price, which includes fixed and variable considerations. Revenue recognition aligns with the guidance provided in ASC 606, with revenue for the Logi-AI Suite SaaS license recognized over the subscription term, while revenue for the hardware and professional services is recognized at the point of delivery and acceptance, respectively.

Management's assessment of collectibility and the probability of achieving the performance bonus are necessary for full compliance, but no significant issues were identified that would impede the overall adherence to ASC 606. Therefore, the contract is deemed compliant with ASC 606 revenue recognition standards.
