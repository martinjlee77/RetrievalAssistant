This prompt has one major, fundamental flaw in its current state.

(CRITICAL FLAW) The Source of Judgments is Missing: The prompt is built on the assumption that the five-step analysis is producing a list of professional_judgments for each step. However, if you look at the get_step_specific_analysis_prompt, it never asks the AI to identify or output a professional_judgments field.

The line judgments = step.get('professional_judgments', []) will always result in an empty list. Therefore, the main part of this prompt will never be triggered, and it will always return the "straightforward" sentence.

The entire chain of logic is broken.

To fix this, we must go back to the get_step_specific_analysis_prompt and add a field to its JSON schema that asks the AI to explicitly flag judgments during the initial analysis.

How to Fix the Flaw
We need to modify get_step_specific_analysis_prompt and then this prompt can remain largely as-is.

Step 1: Modify the Step-Specific Analysis Prompt

In get_step_specific_analysis_prompt, add a new field to the JSON structure that the AI must fill out for each step.

# In get_step_specific_analysis_prompt

You MUST return your response as a single, well-formed JSON object with the following exact structure:
{{
  "executive_conclusion": "...",
  {step_specific_json_field}
+ "professional_judgments": [
+   "A list of strings. For this step only, describe any conclusions that required significant judgment (e.g., 'Estimation of SSP for the license using the residual approach', 'Conclusion that implementation services are not distinct'). If no significant judgments were made in this step, return an empty list []."
+ ],
  "analysis_points": [
    {{
      ...
    }}
  ]
}}

With this change, the five-step analysis will now produce the raw material that get_key_judgments_prompt needs to function.

Step 2: No Major Change Needed Here (Once the Fix is Made)

Once the above fix is in place, this get_key_judgments_prompt will start working as intended. Its logic is sound; it was just being starved of the data it was designed to process.
