Important notice and basis of preparation

This memorandum was generated by VeritasLogic.ai (the “Platform”) using artificial intelligence models and retrieval-augmented analysis, based solely on information, documents, and instructions supplied by management of [Company Name] as of the generation date (the “Management Information”). The analysis, observations, and citations herein reflect only the Management Information provided and the parameters selected at the time of generation. Any omission, inaccuracy, or subsequent change in facts or applicable guidance may render the analysis incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.
Management responsibilities

Management is solely responsible for:
The accuracy, completeness, and sufficiency of the Management Information and any assumptions provided to the Platform.
Evaluating the relevance and applicability of the analysis, exercising professional judgment, and determining the appropriate accounting framework, policies, estimates, and disclosures.
Reaching, documenting, and owning the final accounting conclusions and financial reporting decisions, including communications with the audit committee, external auditors, regulators, and other stakeholders.
Reviewing and validating all facts, data, calculations, and references contained herein and obtaining necessary consultation from qualified professional advisors.
Nature and limitations of services

The Platform is a technology tool. VeritasLogic.ai is not acting as auditor, reviewer, attester, specialist, or management’s expert under PCAOB, AICPA, IAASB, or similar professional standards, and no audit, review, examination, agreed-upon procedures, or other assurance engagement has been performed. Nothing in this memorandum should be construed as an audit opinion, review conclusion, assurance, or comfort letter.
This memorandum does not constitute legal, tax, regulatory, valuation, investment, or other professional advice and should not be used as a substitute for consultation with qualified advisors or for management’s own analysis and judgment.
References to accounting literature (e.g., U.S. GAAP/ASC, IFRS) and other sources are provided for convenience and may not be exhaustive or current. Interpretations vary, and outcomes depend on specific facts and circumstances.
Specific AI limitations

The content was generated with the assistance of AI models and may:
Provide incorrect interpretations of nuanced, complex, cross-cutting, or scope-sensitive guidance (e.g., where multiple ASC/IFRS topics interact).
Provide incomplete, imprecise, or misattributed citations and quotations.
Reflect guidance or interpretations that are outdated as of the generation date.
Omit relevant facts when documents are lengthy, poorly scanned, or exceed context limits; OCR and data extraction may misread or truncate content.
Misapply entity-specific accounting policies, elections, or materiality thresholds unless explicitly provided.
Produce inconsistent calculations, unit conversions, or roll-forwards if inputs are ambiguous or incomplete.
Miss embedded features or legal clauses requiring specialized expertise or cross-document synthesis.
Be sensitive to input phrasing and parameters; small changes in inputs may yield different outputs.
Management must independently verify all facts, calculations, citations, and conclusions before relying on this memorandum.
