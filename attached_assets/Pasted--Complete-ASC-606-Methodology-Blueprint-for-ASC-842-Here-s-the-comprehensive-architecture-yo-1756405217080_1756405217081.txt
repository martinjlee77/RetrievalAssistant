**🏗️ Complete ASC 606 Methodology Blueprint for ASC 842**

Here's the comprehensive architecture you'll need to replicate for ASC 842, organized by component:

---

**📋 1. STEP METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK**

**ASC 606's 5-Step Structure:**

`   Step 1: Identify the Contract  
├── Focus: Contract existence under ASC 606-10-25-1  
├── Key Points: Approval, rights, payment terms, collectibility  
└── Decision: Valid contract exists? 

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations   
├── Focus: Distinct goods/services per ASC 606-10-25-14/25-22  
├── Key Points: Capable of being distinct, distinct in context  
└── Decision: What are the separate performance obligations?  

Step 3: Determine Transaction Price  
├── Focus: Total consideration per ASC 606-10-32-2  
├── Key Points: Fixed, variable, financing components  
└── Decision: What's the total transaction price?  

Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price  
├── Focus: Standalone selling prices (SSPs)  
├── Key Points: Relative SSP method, discount allocation  
└── Decision: How much to each performance obligation?  

Step 5: Recognize Revenue  
├── Focus: When control transfers  
├── Key Points: Over-time vs point-in-time, progress measurement  
└── Decision: When to recognize revenue?   `

**For ASC 842, you'll need similar systematic steps** (likely lease identification, classification, measurement, etc.)

**🔍 2. KNOWLEDGE SEARCH ARCHITECTURE**

**Step-Specific Query Building:**

`   # ASC 606 example structure you'll replicate:  

step_queries = {      
1: "contract existence criteria ASC 606-10-25-1 approval commitment",      
2: "performance obligations distinct goods services ASC 606-10-25-19",       
3: "transaction price consideration ASC 606-10-32-2 variable",      
4: "allocation standalone selling price ASC 606-10-32-28",      
5: "revenue recognition timing over time ASC 606-10-25-27"  }   `

**Contract Term Extraction:**

Each step extracts relevant terms from contracts:

- **Step 1**: approval, commitment, payment terms, collectibility
- **Step 2**: software, services, distinct, bundled, options
- **Step 3**: fees, variable, bonuses, financing, discounts
- **Step 4**: allocation, standalone prices, proportional
- **Step 5**: delivery, control transfer, over-time, milestones

**For ASC 842**: You'll need lease-specific terms (premises, lease term, payments, options, etc.)

**🎯 3. DECISION POINT FRAMEWORK**

**Each Step Requires:**

1. **Authoritative Citations** - Specific ASC paragraph references
2. **Key Analysis Points** - Checklist of evaluation criteria
3. **Decision Logic** - Clear yes/no or classification outcomes
4. **Financial Impacts** - Quantitative conclusions where applicable

**Example Decision Points (ASC 606 Step 2):**

`   ✅ Evaluation Criteria:  
- Can customer benefit from service independently?  
- Is promise separately identifiable from other promises?  
- Are services highly interdependent/interrelated?  
🎯Decision Output:  
- List of distinct performance obligations  
- Bundling recommendations  
- Material rights identification   `

**🚀 6. RAG TESTING STRATEGY**

**Research Assistant Integration:**

1. **Develop step methodology** using Research Assistant Q&A
2. **Test each decision point** with specific lease scenarios
3. **Validate citations** against authoritative guidance
4. **Refine prompts** based on RAG feedback quality

**Example Research Questions for ASC 842:**

- _"What are the key criteria for lease identification under ASC 842?"_
- _"How do I classify leases as operating vs finance under ASC 842?"_
- _"What components are included in lease payment calculations?"_
