MEMORANDUM

TO: Martin Lee Management  
FROM: Accounting Advisory Team  
DATE: July 11, 2025  
RE: ASC 606 Analysis - Test01  

**Executive Summary**

This memorandum provides an analysis of the revenue recognition process for a monthly subscription service for streaming content under ASC 606. The contract, characterized by a fixed monthly fee, has been evaluated across the five-step model of ASC 606. The analysis confirms that the contract is straightforward with low complexity, and revenue recognition is to be executed over the service period. This memo outlines the detailed analysis and provides guidance for implementation.

**Analysis by Step**

**Step 1: Contract Identification**

The contract for the streaming service meets all the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1. The contract is valid as it has been approved by both parties, with clearly identifiable rights and payment terms. It possesses commercial substance, and the collection of consideration is deemed probable. These findings are based on authoritative sources, ensuring compliance with ASC 606 standards.

**Step 2: Performance Obligations**

The analysis identifies a single performance obligation: the provision of the streaming service for one month. This obligation is distinct, as the service is separately identifiable and the customer can benefit from it independently. The distinctness of the service is supported by authoritative guidance, confirming that it meets the criteria for a distinct performance obligation.

**Step 3: Transaction Price**

The transaction price is fixed at USD 15.49 per month, inclusive of a USD 1.03 tax. No variable consideration is present, simplifying the transaction price determination. This fixed consideration aligns with the authoritative guidance under ASC 606, ensuring clarity and consistency in revenue recognition.

**Step 4: Price Allocation**

Given the presence of a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to this obligation. No allocation across multiple obligations is necessary, streamlining the revenue recognition process. This approach is consistent with authoritative guidance, ensuring that the allocation method is appropriate for the contract structure.

**Step 5: Revenue Recognition**

Revenue is to be recognized ratably over the one-month service period as the service is provided. This recognition pattern aligns with the nature of the service and the terms of the contract, ensuring that revenue is recognized in a manner that reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Implementation steps include recognizing revenue evenly over the service period, consistent with authoritative guidance.

**Implementation Guidance**

To ensure compliance with ASC 606, the following steps should be implemented:

1. **Contract Review**: Regularly review contracts to ensure they meet the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-25-1.
2. **Performance Obligation Assessment**: Confirm that all performance obligations are distinct and separately identifiable.
3. **Transaction Price Verification**: Ensure that the transaction price is accurately determined and reflects any fixed or variable considerations.
4. **Revenue Recognition Monitoring**: Implement systems to recognize revenue ratably over the service period, ensuring alignment with the service delivery.
