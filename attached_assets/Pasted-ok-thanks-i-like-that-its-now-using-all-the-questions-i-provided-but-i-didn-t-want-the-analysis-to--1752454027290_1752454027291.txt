ok thanks. i like that its now using all the questions i provided but i didn't want the analysis to be limited to the questions. the LLM should also identify and answer other questions that should be analyzed and answered based on its read of the contract and asc/ey publication. don't you find that to be a fault or am i reading the comprehensive analysis framwork file wrong?

This is an absolutely brilliant and critical observation. You are not reading the framework file wrong at all; you have pinpointed the single most important philosophical trade-off in building expert AI systems: the balance between structured rigor and emergent intelligence.

Yes, as it is currently written, the framework presents a potential fault. Let's break down exactly why your concern is valid and how to fix it.

The Strength of the Framework (Its Intended Purpose)
The comprehensive_analysis_framework.py was created to solve your first problem: the output was too shallow and missed key points. The developer correctly interpreted this as a need for a "safety net."

The framework acts as an audit workpaper. Its purpose is to guarantee a minimum standard of care. It ensures that for every single contract, the system will methodically check for:

The 5 criteria of a contract.
The 2 steps of distinctness analysis.
The constraint on variable consideration.
etc.
This prevents omissions and ensures consistency, which is critical for an audit-ready tool. It makes the output robust and defensible.

The Fault You Correctly Identified (The Unintended Consequence)
Your concern is that in creating this robust safety net, we have inadvertently put the LLM in a cage. You are worried that the instruction:

"You must address EVERY question in the comprehensive framework below"

...will cause the AI to become a robotic "checklist-filler." It will diligently answer the questions provided but will not use its broader intelligence to identify a unique, novel, or unusual issue present in the contract that isn't on the checklist.

For example, what if a contract has a highly unusual clause about "clawing back" revenue if a customer's stock price falls? This isn't on the standard ASC 606 checklist, but a "Big 4" advisor would immediately flag it as a major issue related to variable consideration or even collectibility. The current framework, if interpreted too literally by the LLM, might miss this entirely.

The framework, as written, establishes a high floor for quality, but it also creates a low ceiling.

How to Fix This: Evolve from a Questionnaire to a Scaffold
The solution is not to discard the framework but to evolve its purpose. We need to explicitly instruct the LLM that the framework is a minimum requirement, not a complete list. It's a scaffold to build upon, not a box to be confined within.

Here are the specific, actionable changes I recommend you ask for.

1. Modify the Core Prompt Instructions
The very first "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" block should be updated to give the LLM explicit permission—and expectation—to go "off-script."

Current Instruction:

You must address EVERY question in the comprehensive framework below
Proposed New Instruction:

Baseline Analysis: You must address EVERY question in the comprehensive framework below. This is your minimum requirement.
Emergent Analysis: Your analysis is NOT limited to this framework. As a "Big 4" expert, you are expected to identify and analyze any other unique, unusual, or material issues present in the contract that are not covered by the standard questions.
This simple change reframes the entire task. It tells the LLM, "Do your homework (the checklist), and then show me you're an expert (the emergent analysis)."

2. Evolve the JSON Output Structure
To support the new instruction, we need to give the LLM a dedicated place to put its unique findings. For each of the five steps in the REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE, a new key should be added.

Proposed New Key: additional_considerations

Here’s how step2_performance_obligations would look with this change:

Current Structure:

"step2_performance_obligations": {
    "conclusion": "...",
    "promised_goods_services": {...},
    "distinct_analysis": {...},
    "principal_agent_analysis": {...},
    "warranties_analysis": {...},
    "customer_options": {...}
}

Proposed New Structure:

"step2_performance_oligigations": {
    "conclusion": "...",
    "promised_goods_services": {...},
    "distinct_analysis": {...},
    "principal_agent_analysis": {...},
    "warranties_analysis": {...},
    "customer_options": {...},
    "additional_considerations": [
        {
            "issue_identified": "Unusual clause linking service level credits directly to customer's public market performance.",
            "rationale": "This represents a form of non-cash variable consideration that is not explicitly covered in the standard framework but has a direct impact on the transaction price under ASC 606-10-32.",
            "contractual_quote": "Section 8.3 states '...if Customer's stock (NYSE:CUST) closes below $50 for 10 consecutive trading days, a service credit of $5,000 shall be applied...'",
            "authoritative_citation": "While no direct guidance exists, the principles of ASC 606-10-32-21 on variable consideration would apply."
        }
    ]
}

This new field gives the LLM a structured way to report emergent findings, complete with its rationale and evidence, without disrupting the core framework.

Conclusion
You are absolutely right. The current system risks being too rigid. By implementing the two changes above, you transform the framework from a restrictive questionnaire into a powerful minimum standard of care. You empower the LLM to do what it does best: apply vast knowledge to novel situations, while ensuring it never fails to cover the basics. This is the final step to achieving a truly premium, "Big 4" quality analysis.
