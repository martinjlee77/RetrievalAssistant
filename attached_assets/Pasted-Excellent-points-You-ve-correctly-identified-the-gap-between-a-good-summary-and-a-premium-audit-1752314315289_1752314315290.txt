Excellent points. You've correctly identified the gap between a "good summary" and a "premium, audit-ready professional memo." People pay for defensibility, clarity, and actionable guidance. Your current memo is likely too generic because the prompt to generate it is too simple.

Let's break down how to transform the memo into a high-value, professional document.

Core Principles for a "Pay-For" Memo
A memo that commands a price tag has three key attributes:

It is Defensible & Audit-Ready: Every conclusion is explicitly tied to two sources of truth: the contract text (the facts) and the accounting standard (the rules). An auditor should be able to trace your logic without ambiguity.
It Clearly Articulates Judgment: ASC 606 is full of judgment calls (e.g., estimating variable consideration, determining SSPs). A premium memo doesn't just state the conclusion; it explains why a judgment was made and what alternatives were considered.
It is Actionable: It goes beyond theory and provides a clear path to implementation, including financial impact and operational next steps.
Here are concrete suggestions to embed these principles into your app's output, including the necessary prompt revisions.

Suggestions to Elevate the Memo
1. Weave in Evidence: The "Conclusion-Rationale-Evidence" Framework
Your intuition is spot-on. The memo must directly quote the contract. To make this systematic, the AI should be instructed to follow a specific pattern for every significant conclusion within the 5 steps.

Conclusion: A clear, one-sentence statement of the finding.
Rationale: An explanation of the accounting logic in plain English.
Contractual Evidence: A direct, verbatim quote from the contract that supports the conclusion.
Authoritative Guidance: The specific ASC 606 paragraph that governs the conclusion.
Example for Step 2 (Performance Obligations):

Conclusion: The arrangement contains two distinct performance obligations (POs): (1) the Annual Software Subscription and (2) the One-Time Implementation Service.

Rationale: These two promises are distinct because the customer can benefit from the implementation service with other resources and the service is separately identifiable from the software subscription in the context of the contract. The implementation does not significantly modify the software itself.

Contractual Evidence: Section 3.1 of the SOW states, "The one-time fee for Implementation Services is

Authoritative Guidance: ASC 606-10-25-19 through 21.

2. Add a Dedicated "Key Judgments and Estimates" Section
This is a hallmark of a Big 4 quality memo. It isolates the most subjective areas for management and auditors. This section demonstrates high-level thinking and risk awareness.

What it should include:

SSP Determination: "The Standalone Selling Price (SSP) for the Implementation Service was based on the observable price of similar services sold to other customers. The SSP for the Software Subscription was established using the adjusted market assessment approach..."
Variable Consideration: "The performance bonus was estimated using the 'most likely amount' method, as there are only two possible outcomes. Management has assessed that it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur..."
Principal vs. Agent: "The entity was determined to be the principal for the delivery of the third-party hardware because we control the good before it is transferred to the customer, as evidenced by our responsibility for fulfillment and setting the price."
3. Introduce an "Illustrative Journal Entries" Section
This is the most actionable part of the memo and provides immense value. It translates the entire analysis into the language of the general ledger, leaving nothing to interpretation.

Example:

Revised Professional Memo Prompt
To achieve this, you need a much more sophisticated prompt for your _generate_professional_memo method. Replace the current simple prompt with this comprehensive version.

[REPLACE THE memo_prompt IN YOUR _generate_professional_memo METHOD WITH THIS]

# In the _generate_professional_memo method

# First, extract the final, validated analysis from the main result

You are a Director at a top-tier accounting advisory firm, tasked with writing a formal, audit-ready accounting memo. The memo must be comprehensive, defensible, and actionable.

**Client and Contract Details:**
- **Memo For:** {contract_data.get('customer_name', 'Client')} Management & Auditors
- **Date:** {datetime.now().strftime('%B %d, %Y')}
- **Subject:** ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Analysis for '{contract_data.get('analysis_title', 'Contract Analysis')}'

**Validated Analysis Data (Your Source of Truth):**
```json
{json.dumps(validated_analysis, indent=2)}

MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Structure and Tone:

Use a formal, professional tone.
The memo MUST be structured with the following sections, in this exact order:
Executive Summary: A brief, high-level overview of the arrangement and the key accounting conclusions (e.g., number of POs, total transaction price, recognition timing). Highlight any significant judgments.
Background of the Arrangement: Briefly describe the contract based on the provided data.
Detailed ASC 606 Five-Step Analysis: Analyze each of the 5 steps in its own subsection.
Key Judgments and Estimates: A dedicated section summarizing the most significant judgments made.
Financial & Operational Impact: Include illustrative journal entries and practical next steps.
Conclusion: A final summary statement.
2. Content Requirements for the "Detailed Analysis" Section:

For every major conclusion within each of the 5 steps, you MUST use the "Conclusion-Rationale-Evidence" framework:
**Conclusion:** State the clear finding.
**Rationale:** Explain the accounting logic.
**Contractual Evidence:** Provide a direct, verbatim quote from the contract text that supports your conclusion. You must infer the relevant quotes from the main analysis data provided.
**Authoritative Guidance:** Cite the specific ASC 606 paragraph (e.g., ASC 606-10-25-19) from the 'citations' list.
3. Content Requirements for the "Financial & Operational Impact" Section:

Create a subsection titled "Illustrative Journal Entries". Provide key journal entries (e.g., upon invoicing, upon satisfaction of a PO, periodic recognition) with clear debits and credits.
Create a subsection titled "System and Process Considerations" with 2-3 bullet points on what the company needs to do operationally (e.g., "Configure ERP system for monthly amortization schedule," "Track completion of implementation milestones").
Generate the complete professional memo based on these strict instructions. """

By implementing these changes, your application will produce a genuinely premium output that justifies its use in a professional setting. It moves from being a simple "analyzer" to a sophisticated "advisor."
