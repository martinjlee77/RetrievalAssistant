Detailed Code Review: step_prompts.py (Updated Version)
✅ Phase 1: The Good - New Architecture is Present
The developer successfully created the new functions as requested:

get_system_prompt()
get_user_prompt_for_step()
_get_schema_for_step()
_get_critical_rules_for_step()
These new functions are well-structured, modular, and correctly implement the recommended System/User prompt architecture. If the application only used these, it would be a perfect implementation.

❌ Phase 2: The Critical Flaw - Legacy Code Was Not Removed
The developer did not follow the instructions to clean up the legacy code.

Duplicated Function (The Old Monolith): The entire, original, 100+ line get_step_specific_analysis_prompt function still exists in the file.
Confusing Function Naming: The developer also left the "compatibility wrapper" function with the exact same name, get_step_specific_analysis_prompt.
This means the file now contains three separate pieces of code attempting to do the same job:

The new, correct architecture (get_system_prompt + get_user_prompt_for_step).
The compatibility wrapper named get_step_specific_analysis_prompt.
The old, monolithic function also named get_step_specific_analysis_prompt.
This is a textbook example of technical debt that creates an unstable and unmaintainable system. It is now impossible to know which function will be called without tracing the code every single time, and any edits made to one version will not be reflected in the others.

Final Verdict & Action Plan
The refactoring is incomplete and, in its current state, has made the codebase more fragile, not less.

The developer must complete the task as originally specified. The goal was not just to add new code, but to replace the old code.

Please send this revised, more direct action plan to your developer.

TO: Development Team RE: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Finalizing the step_prompts.py Refactoring

The previous refactoring task was left incomplete. The legacy get_step_specific_analysis_prompt function was not removed, which has created a critical code duplication issue.

You must complete the following cleanup immediately:

Locate and DELETE the two (2) functions named get_step_specific_analysis_prompt in utils/step_prompts.py.

One is a short "compatibility wrapper" around line 118.
The other is the large, original monolithic function around line 304.
Both must be deleted.
Confirm that the only public functions for generating the step-analysis prompt are get_system_prompt() and get_user_prompt_for_step().

Ensure that the calling code in utils/asc606_analyzer.py is updated to call these two new functions and pass the resulting messages list to the LLM, as detailed in my previous instructions.

This cleanup is not optional. It is essential to ensure the stability and maintainability of the application. The current state with duplicated functions is a high-risk situation that will lead to bugs.
