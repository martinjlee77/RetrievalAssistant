High‑level recommendations

Keep Railway for Phase 1. Don’t migrate to Azure yet unless a buyer explicitly requires it. You don’t need Azure hosting to appear in AppSource.
Non‑transactable SaaS listing first. “Get it now (Free trial)” that redirects to your landing page. Keep Stripe for billing initially; consider Microsoft transactable later.
Add Azure AD SSO and monthly subscriptions with included analyses. Keep one‑off Stripe top‑ups as overflow.
Refactor a single generate_memo() function and expose a minimal FastAPI shim. Don’t overbuild the API yet; it’s mainly future‑proofing and will be reused for the Word add‑in.
Architecture review and tweaks Your layout is good. I’d add a few elements to make Phase 1 robust and enterprise‑friendly:

Multitenancy model
database.orgs: id, name, ms_tenant_id (GUID), plan_id, region_pref, created_at
database.users: id, org_id, email, auth_provider (local/azure), azure_oid, role
database.plans: id, name, analyses_per_month, price, features_json
database.entitlements: org_id, month_start, included_analyses, rollover_credits
database.usage: org_id, analysis_id, timestamp, words_tier, status
database.analyses: id, org_id, user_id, standard, status, docx_url, pdf_url, cost_tier, runtime_ms
database.audit_log: org_id, user_id, event, details_json, timestamp
API/worker hygiene
Idempotency keys on job submission (to avoid double‑charging on retries).
Signed URLs with short expiry for docx/pdf downloads (S3/Blob or Railway equivalent).
Rate limiting per org/user (basic token bucket).
Job cancellation endpoint for queued/running analyses.
Security and data handling
Keep “no storage of originals” default. Add a tenant setting for X‑day retention if an enterprise requests it later.
Keep de‑identification, but ensure the de‑identified output includes a simple mapping placeholder table the user can manually reverse if they want.
Publish a subprocessors page (OpenAI, Railway, Stripe, email provider).
Telemetry and status
Add basic runtime metrics (avg time per standard, error rate, queue time, completions).
Public status page via Better Uptime/Statuspage. Don’t promise a contractual 99.9% SLA publicly—make that an Enterprise SLA only.
