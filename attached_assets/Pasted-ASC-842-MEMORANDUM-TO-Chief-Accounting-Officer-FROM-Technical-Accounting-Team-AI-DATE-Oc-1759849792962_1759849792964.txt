RE: ASC842_Analysis_1007_145448 - ASC 842 Lease Accounting Analysis

DOCUMENTS REVIEWED: OFFICE LEASE AGREEMENT.docx

InnovateTech Solutions, Inc. has a lease arrangement that meets the definition of a lease under ASC 842 for identified office premises. The enforceable initial lease term is November 1, 2023 through October 31, 2028; a subsequent five‑year renewal option was excluded from the lease term at commencement because exercise was not reasonably certain based on the facts available in this document‑only analysis. At commencement InnovateTech should record a right‑of‑use (ROU) asset and corresponding lease liability in accordance with ASC 842, with initial measurement based on the present value of the fixed lease payments (subject to finalization of the discount rate and any other inputs).

Classification and measurement will follow the standard ASC 842 approach: apply the finance (front‑loaded interest plus ROU amortization) or operating (single straight‑line lease expense) pattern based on the initial classification assessment; recognize the agreed fixed step rents in accordance with that pattern; expense utilities and any late fees as incurred. Remeasurement of the lease liability and ROU asset is required only upon specified triggers (for example, a change in the lease‑term assessment, an applicable modification, or resolution of a contingent payment), and sublease accounting does not relieve InnovateTech of the head‑lease accounting unless there is a legal release from the primary obligation. Significant judgments in this analysis include the exclusion of the renewal option at commencement and other assumptions made due to limited data; management should confirm discount rate selection and any ASC 842 policy elections (e.g., short‑term lease exemption or practical expedients) when finalizing the accounting.

This memorandum, dated October 2025, provides a document‑only preliminary ASC 842 accounting analysis for InnovateTech Solutions, Inc., with the purpose of evaluating the appropriate lessee accounting treatment for the company’s multi‑year lease of its primary corporate office space. The analysis addresses identification and classification of the arrangement, determination of the lease term (including consideration of renewal and termination options), measurement of the right‑of‑use asset and corresponding lease liability at the present value of expected lease payments, selection of an appropriate discount rate (using the implicit rate where readily determinable or the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate otherwise), and initial and subsequent measurement considerations in accordance with ASC 842. Because this is a preliminary, document‑only review, the analysis relies on reasonable assumptions to fill gaps in missing data and is intended to inform further detailed accounting work and data collection rather than serve as the final accounting conclusion.

ASC 842 ANALYSIS
Step 1: Scope, identify a lease, and determine the enforceable period and lease term
Analysis:

Scope and lease identification. The arrangement is for office real estate and is not an intangible asset, biological asset, inventory, or a service concession arrangement. Therefore, it is within the scope of ASC 842 [ASC 842-10-15-2, 15-3]. The contract grants InnovateTech Solutions, Inc. the right to use a specifically identified office suite: “the office space located at Suite 200, 789 Elm Street… consisting of approximately 1,500 square feet (the ‘Premises’)” [Lease Agreement, 1. Premises]. There is no contractual right for the Landlord to substitute the space. Because a physically distinct suite is named and the contract is silent on any substitution right, we conclude the asset is identified and the Landlord does not have a substantive substitution right (which would require both practical ability to substitute and economic benefit from doing so) [ASC 842-10-15-9 to 15-10, 15-12].

Control of use. The Tenant has exclusive use of the Premises for its business and pays fixed consideration (“Tenant shall pay Landlord monthly rent…”) [Lease Agreement, 3. Rent]. The Tenant’s use is limited to “office space… for the purpose of conducting its business as a technology solutions company” [Lease Agreement, 6. Use]. These are protective restrictions and do not prevent the Tenant from directing how and for what purpose the Premises are used during the term (e.g., choosing hours of operation, occupancy, and layout within the space) [ASC 842-10-15-9, 15-21]. Because the Tenant obtains substantially all economic benefits from the office suite and directs its use during the period of use in exchange for consideration, the contract contains a lease under ASC 842 [ASC 842-10-15-9].

Enforceable period. The agreement states: “The term of this lease shall commence on November 1, 2023, and shall continue for a period of five (5) years, ending October 31, 2028” [Lease Agreement, 2. Term]. There are no mutual termination rights or either‑party termination options during this period; termination is only referenced in the context of “Default” remedies [Lease Agreement, 9. Default]. Under ASC 842, a contract is enforceable until both parties have the right to terminate without more than an insignificant penalty or cost [Master Glossary—Enforceable]. Because neither party can terminate the contract during the initial five‑year term without penalty, the enforceable period includes the entire Initial Term (11/1/2023–10/31/2028).

Lease term within the enforceable period. The lease term includes the noncancellable period plus periods covered by options to extend if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and periods the lessor can require to be extended [Master Glossary—Lease Term]. The contract grants the Tenant “the option to renew this Agreement for an additional five (5) year term” with rent “subject to negotiation… but will not be less than the market rate at the time of renewal” [Lease Agreement, 10. Renewal]. There is no lessor option to extend and no lessee-only termination option. Because extension pricing is at or above then-current market and subject to negotiation, there is no bargain renewal feature. Based solely on the contract, there are no explicit economic factors compelling renewal (e.g., significant tenant-specific improvements, large relocation costs, below-market renewal pricing). Therefore, we are not aware of evidence that makes the renewal “reasonably certain” at commencement; accordingly, we do not include the renewal period in the initial lease term determination [Master Glossary—Lease Term; ASC 842-10-55-23 to 55-26]. If management identifies relevant economic incentives (e.g., material leasehold improvements with remaining useful life, significant relocation costs, importance of location to operations), those factors must be considered in the “reasonably certain” assessment at commencement [Master Glossary—Lease Term].

Reassessment triggers. If a significant event or change in circumstances within the control of the Tenant occurs that affects the reasonable certainty of exercising or not exercising the renewal option (for example, approval of major tenant improvements or a strategic decision to consolidate facilities), the lease term must be reassessed as of the date of the event [ASC 842-10-35-1 to 35-3].

Because the Premises are a specified, physically distinct space with no stated substitution rights, and the Tenant directs the use and obtains economic benefits in exchange for consideration, we conclude the agreement contains a lease under ASC 842. Because there are no termination options during the Initial Term, the enforceable period and initial lease term are the five years from November 1, 2023 through October 31, 2028, excluding the optional renewal absent reasonable certainty of exercise.

Conclusion:

We conclude the contract contains a lease of identified office space under ASC 842 because the Tenant controls the right to use the specified Premises in exchange for consideration [ASC 842-10-15-9]. The enforceable period and initial lease term are November 1, 2023 to October 31, 2028; the five-year renewal option is excluded at commencement absent reasonable certainty of exercise, but must be reassessed upon qualifying events within the Tenant’s control [Master Glossary—Enforceable; Master Glossary—Lease Term; ASC 842-10-35-1 to 35-3].

Issues or Uncertainties:

Substitution/relocation rights: Not specified in contract. [Management Input Required: Confirm the Landlord has no contractual or customary right to relocate Tenant to another space.] This confirmation supports the identified asset conclusion [ASC 842-10-15-9 to 15-12].
Reasonably certain assessment of renewal: Not specified in contract. [Management Input Required: Assess economic incentives or disincentives (e.g., planned leasehold improvements, relocation costs, strategic importance of location) to determine if renewal is reasonably certain at commencement] [Master Glossary—Lease Term].
Commencement date availability: The contract states commencement on November 1, 2023. [Management Input Required: Confirm the Premises were made available for use on November 1, 2023; if different, the accounting commencement date follows actual availability under ASC 842.]
None otherwise identified.
Step 2: Identify components and determine lease payments
Analysis:

Lease and nonlease components. The contract conveys the right to use a single identified asset: the office “Premises” consisting of approximately 1,500 square feet at Suite 200, 789 Elm Street [Lease Agreement, Premises]. Under ASC 842, a lease component is the right to use an underlying asset; nonlease components are distinct services (for example, maintenance) and administrative tasks are not components [ASC 842-10-15-28 through 15-31]. The agreement does not describe any landlord-provided services bundled with rent (for example, no stated common area maintenance, cleaning, or other services). Because the only specified right is the use of the Premises and no services are described, we conclude there is one lease component (the office space) and no identified nonlease components based on the contract text. Tenant-paid utilities are the tenant’s separate obligations (“Tenant shall be responsible for payment of all utilities consumed on the Premises” [Lease Agreement, Utilities]) and are not a component of consideration for the right of use.

Practical expedient election (non-separation). ASC 842 permits a lessee, by asset class, to elect not to separate nonlease components from lease components and account for the combined amount as a single lease component [ASC 842-10-15-37 to 15-38]. Because this agreement does not specify any nonlease components, the election would have no effect here unless management identifies implicit services not stated in the contract. [Management Input Required: Non-separation expedient election by asset class per ASC 842-10-15-37.]

Lease payments to include in the lease liability. ASC 842 requires including in the lease liability: fixed payments (including in-substance fixed), variable payments that depend on an index or rate measured using the index/rate at commencement, amounts probable under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if reasonably certain to be exercised, and termination penalties if the lease term reflects exercising those options, net of lease incentives receivable [ASC 842-20-30-5]. Variable payments not based on an index or rate are excluded from the lease liability and recognized in profit or loss when incurred [ASC 842-20-25].

Fixed lease payments. The rent schedule specifies fixed monthly amounts with 5% annual increases: Year 1 $3,000/month; Year 2 $3,150/month; Year 3 $3,307.50/month; Year 4 $3,472.88/month; Year 5 $3,646.50/month [Lease Agreement, Rent]. Rent is “payable in advance on the first day of each month” [Lease Agreement, Rent]. Because these amounts are predetermined and not contingent, they are fixed lease payments to be included in the lease liability [ASC 842-20-30-5]. The undiscounted total fixed consideration over the noncancelable 5-year Initial Term is $198,922.56, computed as:
Year 1: $3,000 × 12 = $36,000
Year 2: $3,150 × 12 = $37,800
Year 3: $3,307.50 × 12 = $39,690
Year 4: $3,472.88 × 12 = $41,674.56
Year 5: $3,646.50 × 12 = $43,758.00
Total: $198,922.56.

Index/rate-based variable payments. None are specified. The 5% annual increases are predetermined fixed escalations, not tied to an index or rate. Therefore, there are no index/rate-based variables to measure at commencement [ASC 842-20-30-5].
Usage/performance-based variable payments. A $100 late fee applies only if rent is late [Lease Agreement, Rent]. This is avoidable and usage/event-based; it is excluded from the lease liability and expensed if incurred [ASC 842-20-25]. Utilities are borne by the tenant separately (“Tenant shall be responsible for payment of all utilities…” [Lease Agreement, Utilities]) and represent nonlease costs that are expensed as incurred; they are not lease payments.
Residual value guarantees. Not specified in the agreement. Therefore, no RVG amounts are included [Not specified in contract; ASC 842-20-30-5].
Purchase options. None are stated. Therefore, no purchase option amounts are included [Not specified in contract; ASC 842-20-30-5].
Termination options/penalties. No early termination option or penalty is specified in the Initial Term. Therefore, no termination penalties are included [Not specified in contract; ASC 842-20-30-5].
Renewal option. The tenant “shall have the option to renew… for an additional five (5) year term,” with rent “subject to negotiation… but will not be less than the market rate at the time of renewal” [Lease Agreement, Renewal]. Optional periods are included in the lease term only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option [ASC 842-10-30-1]. Because renewal rent will be at least market and there are no contractual economic incentives stated, there is no basis in the contract to conclude the option is reasonably certain. Accordingly, the renewal period is excluded from the lease term and its payments are excluded from the lease liability at commencement. [Management Input Required: Assess whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain per ASC 842-10-30-1.]
Lease incentives receivable. None are stated (no rent abatements, TI allowances, or cash incentives). Therefore, no reduction to lease payments is recorded [Not specified in contract; ASC 842-20-30-5].
Security deposit. A refundable security deposit of $3,000 is required and “shall be returned… within thirty (30) days after the termination… less any deductions for damages… or unpaid rent” [Lease Agreement, Security Deposit]. Because the deposit is refundable and not a payment for the right to use the asset, it is not a lease payment under ASC 842-20-30-5. It should be recorded separately (e.g., as a deposit asset), with any applied amounts accounted for if and when they occur.
Other relevant inputs. The contract specifies rent is “payable in advance on the first day of each month” [Lease Agreement, Rent], which affects the present value timing but not the composition of lease payments. The discount rate is required to measure the lease liability; if the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the lessee uses its incremental borrowing rate (or may elect the risk-free rate by class if eligible) [ASC 842-20-30-2 to 30-3]. [Management Input Required: Specify the lessee’s discount rate at commencement per ASC 842-20-30-2/30-3.]

Conclusion:

We conclude the contract contains one lease component (the office Premises) and no identifiable nonlease components based on the written terms [ASC 842-10-15-28 to 15-31]. Lease payments included in the lease liability are the fixed monthly rents for the 5-year Initial Term, payable in advance, totaling undiscounted $198,922.56. Variable/contingent amounts (utilities, late fees), renewal-period rents, refundable security deposit, and any items not specified (e.g., RVGs, purchase options) are excluded [ASC 842-20-30-5; ASC 842-20-25; ASC 842-10-30-1].

Issues or Uncertainties:

[Management Input Required: Non-separation expedient election by asset class per ASC 842-10-15-37.]
[Management Input Required: Assess whether the 5-year renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised per ASC 842-10-30-1.]
[Management Input Required: Specify lessee discount rate at commencement (implicit rate if determinable; otherwise IBR or risk-free rate election if applicable) per ASC 842-20-30-2/30-3.]
[Management Input Required: Confirm no landlord-provided services (e.g., CAM) are embedded in rent; if identified, apply separation or expedient.]
[Management Input Required: Confirm no lease incentives (e.g., TI allowances, abatements) exist outside the written agreement.]
Step 3: Classify the lease and measure at commencement
Analysis:

Commencement date. The lease “shall commence on November 1, 2023” and run through October 31, 2028 [Lease Agreement, "Term"]. Under ASC 842, the lessee recognizes the lease at commencement, defined as when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessee [ASC 842-20-25-1; ASC 842-10-55]. Because the lease explicitly begins on November 1, 2023 and there is no evidence of earlier access, we will treat November 1, 2023 as the commencement date.
Classification (finance vs. operating). A lease is a finance lease if any one of the following is met: (a) transfers ownership by end of term, (b) lessee is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, (c) lease term is a major part of the economic life, (d) present value of lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value, or (e) the asset is so specialized it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at end of term [ASC 842-10-25-2]. Based on the contract:
Ownership transfer: Not specified in contract (no transfer stated) → not met.
Purchase option: Not specified in contract → not met.
Specialized asset/no alternative use: The asset is standard office space; no indication of specialization → not met.
Major part of economic life and PV substantially all FV: Economic life and fair value of the Premises are Not specified in contract. Because these data are missing, we cannot quantitatively evaluate criteria (c) or (d). However, offices typically have long economic lives relative to a 5-year term, and the rent resets annually at fixed amounts; nonetheless, classification must be based on actual facts. [Management Input Required: Provide the remaining economic life of the office space and the fair value at commencement to corroborate that the lease term is not a “major part” and the PV of payments is not “substantially all.” See ASC 842-10-25-2.]
Renewal option. Tenant has an “option to renew … for an additional five (5) year term,” with rent “not … less than the market rate at the time of renewal” [Lease Agreement, "Renewal"]. Optional periods are included in the lease term only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option [ASC 842-10-30-1; ASC 842-10-25-2(b)]. Because renewal rent will be at least market and the contract provides no incentives binding the lessee to renew, there is no evidence renewal is reasonably certain at commencement. [Management Input Required: Assess whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain given business plans, location dependence, and costs of relocation.]
Conclusion on classification. Because there is no ownership transfer or purchase option, no indication of specialization, and no evidence that a renewal is reasonably certain, we conclude the lease is an operating lease, subject to confirmation that the remaining two criteria (major part/substantially all) are not met. Classification is determined at commencement and is not reassessed unless the lease is modified and reclassified under ASC 842 [ASC 842-10-25-8].
Lease payments to include in measurement. The contract requires fixed monthly rent “payable in advance on the first day of each month” with annual 5% increases [Lease Agreement, "Rent"] as follows:
Year 1: $3,000 per month ($36,000 annually)
Year 2: $3,150 per month ($37,800 annually)
Year 3: $3,307.50 per month ($39,690 annually)
Year 4: $3,472.88 per month ($41,674.56 annually)
Year 5: $3,646.50 per month ($43,758 annually)
Total undiscounted fixed payments over the noncancellable 5-year term: $198,922.56.

Under ASC 842, the lease liability is measured at the present value of lease payments, including fixed payments and excluding variable payments not based on an index or rate, reduced by lease incentives [ASC 842-20-30-5]. Because utilities are paid directly by the Tenant and are usage-based [Lease Agreement, "Utilities"], they are variable costs outside the lease payments and excluded from the liability [ASC 842-20-30-5]. The $100 late fee is a penalty contingent on nonperformance and is not included in the initial measurement.

Security deposit and other cash flows. The $3,000 refundable security deposit is held by the Landlord and returned at termination, net of damages or unpaid amounts [Lease Agreement, "Security Deposit"]. Because it is refundable and not a payment for the right of use, it is not a lease payment under ASC 842 and is accounted for separately (e.g., as a deposit asset). No lease incentives are specified. Initial direct costs incurred by the lessee are Not specified in contract.
Lease term. The noncancellable lease term is five years (November 1, 2023 to October 31, 2028) [Lease Agreement, "Term"]. Renewal periods are excluded unless reasonably certain [ASC 842-10-30-1]. Based on available information, we exclude the renewal term at initial measurement. [Management Input Required: Confirm not reasonably certain to renew.]
Initial measurement at commencement.
Lease liability. Measure at the present value of the unpaid lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable; otherwise, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR) at commencement [ASC 842-20-30-5]. Payments are due in advance, so discount as an annuity due.
Cash flow timing: first payment due on November 1, 2023 (commencement). Because that payment is made at commencement, it is not included in the lease liability (it is not “unpaid” at commencement).
[Management Input Required: Specify the discount rate per ASC 842-20-30-3 (rate implicit if readily determinable; otherwise, IBR). Provide the compounding convention (monthly) consistent with payment frequency.]
Right-of-use (ROU) asset. Initially measured as: lease liability + any prepaid lease payments (e.g., the first month paid at commencement) + initial direct costs – lease incentives + any asset retirement obligations recognized under ASC 410 [ASC 842-20-30-1; ASC 842-20-25-1].
Prepaid rent: The November 1, 2023 payment of $3,000 is a prepaid amount at commencement and increases the ROU asset.
Initial direct costs: Not specified in contract. [Management Input Required: Identify any lessee-borne incremental costs of obtaining the lease, such as external commissions.]
Lease incentives: Not specified in contract.
AROs: Not specified in contract. [Management Input Required: Confirm whether any restoration obligations exist; if so, measure under ASC 410 and include in ROU asset.]
Subsequent recognition pattern. Because the lease is classified as operating, total lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with interest on the lease liability and amortization of the ROU asset recognized such that the single lease cost is straight-line [ASC 842-20-25-6 through 25-7]. Classification is not reassessed unless there is a qualifying modification [ASC 842-10-25-8].
Short-term lease policy election. The lease term exceeds 12 months; therefore, the short-term lease recognition exemption does not apply. If the entity has a short-term policy election for other leases, it would not be applicable here [ASC 842-20-25-2].
Conclusion:

We conclude the office lease should be classified as an operating lease because there is no ownership transfer, no purchase option, no indication of a specialized asset with no alternative use, and no evidence that renewal is reasonably certain; the remaining criteria (major part of economic life and PV substantially all of FV) appear unlikely but require management corroboration due to missing life and FV data [ASC 842-10-25-2]. At the November 1, 2023 commencement date, measure the lease liability at the present value of the fixed monthly rents over the 5-year noncancellable term, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if known or the lessee’s IBR; measure the ROU asset as the lease liability adjusted for the first day’s prepaid rent, any initial direct costs, lease incentives, and any AROs [ASC 842-20-25-1; ASC 842-20-30-1, 30-5].

Issues or Uncertainties:

Discount rate: Not specified in contract. [Management Input Required: Specify rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable; otherwise, provide lessee IBR at 11/1/2023 per ASC 842-20-30-3.]
Renewal option: Economic factors supporting “reasonably certain” exercise not provided. [Management Input Required: Conclude whether the 5-year renewal is reasonably certain at commencement; if so, include in the lease term per ASC 842-10-30-1.]
Economic life and fair value: Not specified. [Management Input Required: Provide remaining economic life of the Premises and its fair value at commencement to corroborate that criteria (c) and (d) for finance lease classification are not met (ASC 842-10-25-2).]
Initial direct costs: Not specified. [Management Input Required: Identify any incremental costs of obtaining the lease to include in the ROU asset (ASC 842-20-30-1).]
Asset retirement obligation: Not specified. [Management Input Required: Identify any restoration/ARO requirements and measure under ASC 410; include in ROU asset if applicable.]
Step 5: Reminders beyond initial recognition (no computations)
Analysis:

Subsequent expense recognition pattern
If classified as a finance lease, InnovateTech will recognize interest on the lease liability and amortization of the ROU asset separately over the lease term. Because ASC 842 requires a financing pattern for finance leases, the liability accretes interest and the ROU asset is amortized generally on a straight-line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative [ASC 842-20-25].
If classified as an operating lease, InnovateTech will recognize a single straight-line lease cost, with the lease liability reduced using the effective interest method and the ROU asset adjusted so total lease cost is straight-line over the lease term [ASC 842-20-25; ASC 842-10-55-229].
Variable payments excluded from the lease liability are expensed as incurred. Because the contract requires the Tenant to pay all utilities and includes a potential late fee, these are variable amounts that depend on usage or events and therefore are recognized in profit or loss in the period incurred (not included in the lease liability) [Lease Agreement, "Utilities"]; [Lease Agreement, "Rent"]; [ASC 842-20-25].
Contract features relevant to subsequent periods
Fixed stepped rent: Monthly rent increases 5% annually during the initial 5-year term (e.g., Year 1 $3,000/month increasing to Year 5 $3,646.50/month) [Lease Agreement, "Rent"]. Because these are known fixed payments, they remain in the lease liability schedule unless a remeasurement trigger occurs [ASC 842-10-35-1].
Renewal option: Tenant “shall have the option to renew … for an additional five (5) year term,” with rent “subject to negotiation … but will not be less than the market rate at the time of renewal” [Lease Agreement, "Renewal"]. Because renewal rent is not fixed and will be set at or above market, renewal-period payments are excluded from the lease liability unless management concludes the option is reasonably certain to be exercised; if that assessment changes, a remeasurement is required [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3].
Utilities and other pass-throughs: Tenant is responsible for all utilities [Lease Agreement, "Utilities"], which are non-lease services and typically expensed as incurred unless InnovateTech elects the practical expedient to combine non-lease components with lease components [ASC 842-10-15 (component separation principles)]. Because the contract does not specify fixed utility payments, these amounts remain out of the lease liability and are recognized as period costs.
Security deposit: A refundable $3,000 security deposit is due at execution [Lease Agreement, "Security Deposit"]. Because refundable deposits are not lease payments unless and until applied, account for the deposit separately as an asset and only reflect it in lease accounting if it is applied or forfeited (then recognized in the period of application/forfeiture under ASC 842’s variable payment framework).
Remeasurement triggers to monitor
Change in lease term or purchase option assessment: If a significant event or change in circumstances within InnovateTech’s control causes the renewal option to become “reasonably certain” to be exercised or not exercised, remeasure the lease liability using an updated discount rate and reassess classification [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3].
Resolution of contingencies that make payments fixed: If any payments become fixed due to resolution of a contingency (e.g., a negotiated amendment converting previously variable amounts to fixed), remeasure the lease [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3].
Residual value guarantee: Not specified in the contract. If later agreed and the probable amount changes, remeasure [ASC 842-10-35-1].
Index/rate changes: Not applicable to the base rent in this agreement (fixed step rents). As a reminder, under ASC 842, changes in an index or rate do not cause remeasurement by themselves; they are expensed as variable costs unless another remeasurement trigger occurs. If remeasurement is required for another reason, update the variable payments based on the then-current index/rate [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3].
Lease modifications
Assess separate-contract criteria: A modification is a separate lease if (1) it grants an additional right of use not included in the original lease and (2) lease consideration increases commensurate with the standalone price of the additional right of use, adjusted for the contract’s circumstances [ASC 842-10-25-8].
If not a separate contract: Remeasure the lease liability, reallocate consideration to lease and non-lease components, and reassess classification as of the effective date of the modification [ASC 842-10-25-9 to 25-10]. For example, adding or giving back square footage or changing the term or rent for the existing Premises typically requires remeasurement unless it meets separate-contract criteria.
Subleases or assignment
If InnovateTech subleases the Premises, it becomes an intermediate lessor. Classify the sublease by reference to the head-lease ROU asset (not the underlying real estate) and account for the head lease and sublease separately [ASC 842-10].
Legal release from the head lease: Only if the sublease/assignment legally relieves InnovateTech of the “primary obligation under the original lease” is the head lease accounted for as a termination (derecognize the ROU asset and lease liability; recognize any difference in profit or loss) [ASC 842-20-40-3; ASC 842-20-40-1]. Because the Agreement does not state that a sublease or assignment relieves InnovateTech, assume continuing primary obligation unless a formal release is obtained.
If not relieved: Continue accounting for the head lease as before. If expected sublease income is less than head-lease cost during the sublease term, consider ROU asset impairment indicators under ASC 842/ASC 360 [ASC 842-20-35-14].
Presentation and disclosures
Presentation: Present operating lease ROU assets and liabilities separately from finance lease balances or disclose them separately in the notes. Finance leases present interest expense and amortization separately; operating leases present a single lease cost within operating results [ASC 842-20-45-1; ASC 842-20-25].
Periodic disclosures: Disclose lease cost components (operating, finance interest and amortization, short-term lease cost if any, variable lease cost including utilities and late fees, and any sublease income), weighted-average remaining lease term, weighted-average discount rate, and a maturity analysis of lease liabilities by year with a reconciliation to the balance sheet [ASC 842-20-50-1].
Significant judgments and policies: Disclose judgments about “reasonably certain” options (e.g., renewal), allocation of consideration between lease and non-lease components or the practical expedient to combine, discount rate policy (IBR), and conclusions around modifications or subleases [ASC 842-20-50-1].
Because the Agreement contains fixed step rents for a five-year term [Lease Agreement, "Term"]; [Lease Agreement, "Rent"], subsequent accounting will primarily follow a steady pattern unless a remeasurement trigger occurs (e.g., renewal option assessment change or a modification) [ASC 842-10-35-1 through 35-3]. Because utilities are tenant-paid and variable [Lease Agreement, "Utilities"], those costs should continue to be recognized as variable lease (or non-lease) expense as incurred rather than included in the lease liability [ASC 842-20-25].

Key management inputs to obtain and document for later periods:

[Management Input Required: Specify IBR policy and discount rate updates upon remeasurement per ASC 842-20-30-3.]
[Management Input Required: Assess “reasonably certain” conclusion for the 5-year renewal option each reporting period for trigger events per ASC 842-10-35-1.]
[Management Input Required: Elect or decline the practical expedient to combine non-lease components (e.g., utilities) with lease components per ASC 842-10-15.]
[Management Input Required: Define modification controls to evaluate separate-contract criteria per ASC 842-10-25-8 to 25-10.]
[Management Input Required: Sublease/assignment policy and required legal releases to achieve lease termination accounting per ASC 842-20-40-3.]
Conclusion:

We conclude InnovateTech should follow either the finance pattern (interest plus ROU amortization) or the operating pattern (single straight-line lease cost) based on initial classification, and then continue recognizing fixed step rents accordingly, with utilities and any late fees expensed as incurred [ASC 842-20-25; ASC 842-10-55-229]. Remeasurement is required only upon specified triggers (e.g., change in lease term assessment, applicable modification, or contingency resolution), and sublease accounting must retain the head lease unless there is a legal release from primary obligation [ASC 842-10-35-1 to 35-3; ASC 842-20-40-3].

Issues or Uncertainties:

Discount rate/IBR not specified in the contract. [Management Input Required: Specify IBR per ASC 842-20-30-3.]
Assessment of “reasonably certain” to exercise the renewal option is not provided. [Management Input Required: Document the assessment at inception and update for trigger events per ASC 842-10-35-1.]
Practical expedient elections (e.g., combining non-lease components) are not specified. [Management Input Required: Determine and disclose per ASC 842-10-15 and ASC 842-20-50-1.]
Residual value guarantee terms are not specified in the contract (Not specified). If later added, monitor for remeasurement [ASC 842-10-35-1].
Sublease/assignment rights or landlord consent requirements are not specified (Not specified). Legal release must be confirmed to apply termination accounting [ASC 842-20-40-3].
Based on the step conclusions, the identification of the contract as a lease of identified office space and the determination of the enforceable period and initial lease term from November 1, 2023 to October 31, 2028, with the five-year renewal option excluded absent reasonable certainty, are consistent with ASC 842 requirements. The prescribed classification guidance, recognition of fixed step rents under either the finance or operating pattern, expensing of utilities and late fees as incurred, remeasurement only upon specified triggers, and retention of head-lease accounting absent a legal release indicate InnovateTech’s accounting approach is in compliance with ASC 842.
