Thanks—good structure and plain language. To make this accurate for ASC 805 and useful to both execs and technical accountants, a few must‑fix technical corrections and several high‑impact additions are needed.

Must‑fix accuracy corrections

Consideration transferred definition
Do not include “assumed liabilities” in consideration transferred. Consideration transferred generally includes cash, equity issued, and the fair value of contingent consideration. Liabilities assumed are part of identifiable net assets, not consideration.
Goodwill formula (simplified): Goodwill = Consideration transferred + NCI at fair value + fair value of previously held interest − fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
Deferred revenue “haircut” impact
Your impact statement is reversed. A lower acquired contract liability (the “haircut”) typically results in less revenue recognized post‑acquisition for the remaining performance obligations than the target would have recognized on a standalone basis. That often depresses post‑acquisition revenue/earnings for those contracts.
Keep the fair value concept (cost to fulfill plus a reasonable profit margin consistent with a market participant), but clarify the revenue impact.
Contingent consideration remeasurement
Only liability‑classified contingent consideration is remeasured through earnings each reporting period. Equity‑classified contingent consideration is not remeasured; settlement is accounted for within equity.
Distinguish measurement‑period adjustments (within one year of the acquisition date) that adjust provisional amounts and goodwill from post‑measurement‑period changes that go to earnings.
IPR&D treatment
In‑process R&D is recognized as an indefinite‑lived intangible asset at acquisition date (not amortized). After completion, it is amortized over its useful life; if abandoned, it is expensed. Add this explicitly.
Acquisition‑related costs
These are expensed as incurred (not included in consideration or assets), e.g., banker, legal, due diligence fees. Debt/equity issuance costs follow their own guidance.
Goodwill impairment and private company alternative
Public entities: annual impairment test (or qualitative Step 0) and upon triggering events; one‑step test (fair value vs carrying value) with impairment limited to goodwill.
Private company accounting alternative: amortize goodwill (generally over 10 years or less if appropriate) and test for impairment only upon triggering events.
High‑impact additions (executive‑friendly, with depth for practitioners)

Measurement period
State that acquirers can record provisional amounts and adjust them within one year of the acquisition date as new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. These adjustments change goodwill.
Noncontrolling interests (NCI) and step acquisitions
NCI is recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. In a step acquisition, remeasure the previously held equity interest to fair value with resulting gain/loss in earnings.
Income taxes interplay
Recognize deferred taxes on fair value adjustments (e.g., customer relationships). This often increases goodwill. Distinguish tax‑deductible vs non‑deductible goodwill for future effective tax rate impacts.
Reacquired rights and pre‑existing relationships
Reacquired rights (e.g., a franchise or distribution right previously granted) are recognized at fair value and amortized over the remaining contractual term (renewal periods are ignored). Settlement of pre‑existing relationships may result in gains/losses separate from the business combination accounting.
Intangible asset lives and amortization
Definite‑lived intangibles (customer relationships, developed technology, trade names in many cases) are amortized over their useful lives; indefinite‑lived intangibles (certain trade names, IPR&D) are not amortized but tested for impairment.
Contingencies
Recognize a contingent liability at acquisition date if it is a present obligation and its fair value can be measured reliably; otherwise disclose. Post‑acquisition changes follow ASC 450.
Targeted wording you can paste in

PPA Framework (replace your bullets with):
Determine the acquisition date (when control transfers).
Measure consideration transferred at fair value (cash, equity issued, contingent consideration).
Recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition‑date fair value (subject to specific exceptions).
Recognize NCI at fair value (if applicable) and remeasure previously held interest to fair value in a step acquisition.
Record goodwill as the residual: Consideration + NCI + fair value of previously held interest − fair value of identifiable net assets.
Deferred Revenue: replace with:
“Acquired revenue contracts are recognized at acquisition‑date fair value. For remaining performance obligations, fair value often reflects cost to fulfill plus a market participant profit margin, which is typically less than the acquiree’s deferred revenue carrying amount (the ‘haircut’). Impact: This usually results in lower revenue recognized post‑acquisition for those contracts than the target would have recorded on a standalone basis.”
Contingent Consideration: replace “Subsequent Updates” with:
“Subsequent measurement: Liability‑classified contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value through earnings each period. Equity‑classified contingent consideration is not remeasured. Measurement‑period adjustments (within one year) that relate to facts and circumstances at the acquisition date adjust provisional amounts and goodwill.”
IPR&D: add under Technology Assets:
“IPR&D is recognized as an indefinite‑lived intangible asset at acquisition. It is not amortized until completion (then amortized over its useful life); if abandoned, the carrying amount is expensed.”
Acquisition‑related costs: add to Documentation or Framework:
“Acquisition‑related costs (banker, legal, diligence) are expensed as incurred; financing/equity issuance costs follow their respective guidance.”
Goodwill section: append:
“Public entities test goodwill for impairment annually (or upon triggering events); private companies may elect to amortize goodwill (generally over 10 years) and test only upon triggers.”
Nice‑to‑add clarity tweaks

Fair value approaches: For customer relationships under the income approach, note that a multi‑period excess earnings method (MPEEM) is common; document attrition assumptions and contributory asset charges.
Trade names: Clarify policy on definite vs indefinite life; relief‑from‑royalty inputs (royalty rate benchmarking, brand strength).
Non‑competes: Often valued with a with‑and‑without/incremental cash flow model; useful lives typically align with contract term and enforceability.
Disclosures: Add that ASC 805 requires disclosure of the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for each major class of assets and liabilities, goodwill by reportable segment (if practicable), and the amounts of revenue and earnings of the acquiree included in the consolidated results since the acquisition date.
