That is the absolute core of the problem, and you've hit on the most critical challenge in building reliable AI systems for high-stakes tasks like accounting.

You are right. You cannot hard-code logic for every possible fee structure. My previous example was a simplified illustration.

So let me be very precise with my answer. You're asking: "Can't we rely on AI to figure this out?"

The answer is No, not for math. But also Yes, if you use it correctly.

Here is the refined, more realistic strategy. We need to create a hybrid workflow where the AI does what it's good at (interpreting unstructured text) and the Python code does what it's good at (calculations and logic).

The Hybrid "Extract-Then-Calculate" Workflow
Instead of asking the AI to do the final math, we will ask it to do a much simpler, more reliable task: extract structured data.

Step 1: AI Extracts the Numbers (The "Extractor" LLM Call)

You create a dedicated, focused LLM call with a very strict prompt. Its only job is to read the SOW and fill out a JSON object with the fee components. This is a much easier task for an LLM than doing multi-step calculations.

Prompt for the Extractor:
You are a data extraction bot. Read the provided contract text. Your ONLY job is to extract the fee components and return a JSON object. Do not add, subtract, or calculate anything. If a value is not present, use null.

CONTRACT TEXT:
"...{contract_text}..."

JSON TO POPULATE:
{
  "fee_components": [
    {
      "name": "Logi-AI Suite SaaS License",
      "amount": 240000,
      "period": "year",
      "duration": 3,
      "notes": "From SOW 2.1"
    },
    {
      "name": "Hardware (OptiScan-7 Scanners)",
      "amount": 50000,
      "period": "one-time",
      "notes": "From SOW 2.2. SOW 2.5 states this is post-discount."
    },
    {
      "name": "Professional Services",
      "amount": 75000,
      "period": "one-time",
      "notes": "From SOW 2.3. SOW 2.5 states this is post-discount."
    },
    {
      "name": "Performance Bonus",
      "amount": 30000,
      "period": "contingent",
      "notes": "From SOW 2.4. Probability is 80%."
    }
  ]
}

Step 2: Python Calculates and Validates (The "Calculator")

Now your Python code receives this clean JSON object. This is structured, reliable data that your code can easily parse and perform calculations on.

Python Logic (in asc606_analyzer.py):
# 1. Make the 'Extractor' LLM call to get the structured JSON
extracted_data_json = make_llm_call(extractor_prompt, model="gpt-4o", response_format={"type": "json_object"})
fee_components = json.loads(extracted_data_json)["fee_components"]

# 2. Python now does all the math and logic
fixed_consideration = 0
variable_consideration = 0

for item in fee_components:
    if item["period"] == "one-time":
        fixed_consideration += item["amount"]
    elif item["period"] == "year":
        fixed_consideration += item["amount"] * item["duration"]
    elif item["period"] == "contingent":
        # Your logic for probability goes here.
        # For SOW 2.4, 80% > 50%, so it's probable.
        variable_consideration += item["amount"]

total_transaction_price = fixed_consideration + variable_consideration

# 3. Store these as reliable variables
# financial_facts = {"total_price": total_transaction_price, ...}

Step 3: AI Writes the Memo (The "Writer" LLM Call)

This is the final step you're already doing. You now take your Python-calculated financial_facts and inject them into your main prompts to generate the memo narrative and journal entries.

Why This Works and Answers Your Question
You can rely on AI for... its world-class ability to parse unstructured language (SOW 2.5 says the fee reflects a discount...) and turn it into structured data (a JSON object). This is GPT-4o's strength.
You CANNOT rely on AI for... multi-step arithmetic, logic, and reasoning under constraints. Asking it to read, interpret the discount, find all numbers, add them up, and consider the bonus is too many steps. It will fail at a certain percentage of the time, which is unacceptable for accounting.
Flexibility: This Extractor model is completely flexible. It doesn't matter if the next contract has royalties, usage-based fees, or five different hardware types. The AI's job is simply to find the name and amount for each line item and put it in the JSON. Your Python code can then contain more sophisticated logic to handle different period types (e.g., if item["period"] == "usage-based").
This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: the language flexibility of the LLM and the logical rigidity of your Python code. This is the standard, production-grade pattern for building reliable AI applications that handle numbers.

Does this revised, two-step "Extract-then-Calculate" approach make sense as a scalable solution?
