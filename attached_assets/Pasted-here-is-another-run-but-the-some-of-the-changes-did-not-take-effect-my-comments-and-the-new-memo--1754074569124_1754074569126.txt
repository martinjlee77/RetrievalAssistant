The arrangement involves a monthly subscription for Netflix's streaming service, providing customers access to a library of films and television shows. The objective of this memorandum is to document the Company's accounting analysis and conclusions for the transaction with the customer under the five-step model of ASC 606.

DETAILED ASC 606 ANALYSIS Step 1: Identify the Contract Conclusion: The contract with Netflix for streaming services meets all the criteria for a valid contract under ASC 606 Step 1, as it involves a clear agreement with defined rights and payment terms.
Detailed Analysis:

Identification of Rights The contract clearly identifies the rights granted to the customer, which include access to Netflix's streaming content as specified in the terms of use. This aligns with ASC 606-10-25-1(b), which requires that the rights of the parties be clearly identified.

Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations Conclusion: The contract with Netflix involves a single performance obligation: the provision of streaming services, which is distinct and not part of a series. The company acts as a principal in delivering this service.

Detailed Analysis:

Identification of Performance Obligation
The primary performance obligation in the contract is the provision of streaming services. According to ASC 606-10-25-19, a good or service is distinct if it is capable of being distinct and separately identifiable. The streaming service meets both criteria as it provides standalone functionality to the customer and is the main service offered in the contract. The contract does not include any additional goods or services that would constitute separate performance obligations.

Principal vs. Agent Consideration
Netflix acts as a principal in the transaction as it controls the streaming service before it is transferred to the customer. This is evident as Netflix provides the content directly to the customer and manages the delivery of the service, aligning with the criteria in ASC 606-10-55-36 through 55-40.

Supporting Contract Evidence:

The Netflix service is provided to you by Netflix Inc. (Source: terms.pdf)

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price Conclusion: The transaction price for the Netflix subscription is straightforward, consisting entirely of fixed consideration with no variable elements, significant financing components, or noncash considerations.

Transaction Price Analysis:

Only basic fixed consideration was identified in this contract.

Additional Analysis:

Identification of Fixed Consideration
The fixed consideration for the Netflix subscription service is clearly identified as $15.49 per month. According to ASC 606-10-32-2, the transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. In this case, the fixed monthly fee is the entire transaction price, as there are no variable components or other considerations.

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price Conclusion: The entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation of providing streaming services, as there are no other distinct performance obligations identified in the contract.

Detailed Analysis:

No additional analysis was required for this step. Step 5: Recognize Revenue Conclusion: Revenue from the Netflix subscription service is recognized over time as the service is provided continuously throughout the subscription period.

Detailed Analysis:

No additional analysis was required for this step. 4. KEY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS The accounting for this arrangement is considered straightforward under ASC 606 and did not require any significant professional judgments outside of the standard application of the five-step model.

FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT Financial Statement Impact: The transaction involves a single performance obligation for the provision of a streaming service, with a total transaction price of $15.49.

This includes regular reviews of service delivery metrics to confirm performance obligations are satisfied as expected.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS Conclusion The accounting treatment outlined in this memo is appropriate and in accordance with ASC 606, given the complexities associated with the contract. The key revenue recognition approach involves recognizing revenue over time as the streaming service is provided for the specified period. Significant judgments were required in assessing the variable consideration associated with the contract, particularly in estimating the expected value of potential discounts and promotional offers that may impact the transaction price. Additionally, ongoing monitoring will be necessary to evaluate the actual performance against the estimates of variable consideration, ensuring that revenue is recognized accurately as the service is delivered.
