You're using a very dark background (#212F3C). This creates a challenge because subtle variations in shade are harder to distinguish against such a dark base. Using the same color for everything will make the page feel visually monotonous and lack the necessary visual hierarchy to guide the user's eye. Harvey.ai uses dark colors effectively, but they incorporate lighter accents for contrast.

Here are some color palette suggestions to complement #212F3C, keeping a modern feel and improving readability:

Option 1 (High Contrast):

Background: #212F3C (your existing choice)
Primary Text: #ffffff (white – remains a good choice for readability)
Accent Color 1 (Buttons, Calls to Action): #64B5F6 (a vibrant, but not overly bright, light blue). This will stand out nicely against the dark background.
Accent Color 2 (Subheadings, dividers): #A7CCD1 (a lighter gray-blue) – Provides a softer contrast for less important elements.
This option uses a strong color contrast for calls to action but has a lighter accent to balance it and separate it.

Option 2 (Subtle Contrast):

Background: #212F3C
Primary Text: #ffffff (white)
Accent Color 1 (Buttons, CTAs): #42A5F5 (a slightly darker, more saturated light blue)
Accent Color 2 (Subheadings): #8AB4D2 (a slightly desaturated blue-gray)
This uses a more subtle contrast, maintaining a more unified color scheme.

Option 3 (Monochromatic with Texture):

Since you want to avoid distinct color separation, consider a monochromatic approach with variations in texture or shade within the #212F3C range. This is more challenging to execute visually but can create a sophisticated look. You would use shades of #212F3C (slightly darker or lighter) for section dividers, backgrounds within sections, etc., relying on subtle shifts in tone instead of distinct colors. This requires careful attention to visual hierarchy through typography, spacing, and possibly subtle background textures.

Implementation Suggestions:

Section Separation: Instead of a color change, consider using subtle visual dividers between sections: thin lines, slightly lighter background shades of #212F3C, or even small graphic elements.

Typography: Use different font weights (bold, regular, light) to create visual hierarchy within sections without relying on color alone. Larger fonts for headings, smaller fonts for body text.

Spacing & Padding: Use ample white space (even though your background is dark) to separate content blocks and avoid a cluttered feel. This will improve visual clarity.

Interactive Elements: Use subtle hover effects (a slight color shift, change in opacity, or a subtle shadow) on interactive elements (buttons, links) to improve usability and make them stand out without a large color change.

Remember to test these options on your design mockups. See which color palette provides the best readability, visual hierarchy, and aligns with the modern, professional feel you are aiming for. Consider creating multiple mockups with different color palettes and comparing them. User feedback (if possible) is always valuable.
