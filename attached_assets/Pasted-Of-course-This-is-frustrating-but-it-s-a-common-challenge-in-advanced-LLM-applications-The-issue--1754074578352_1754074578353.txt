Of course. This is frustrating, but it's a common challenge in advanced LLM applications. The issue is no longer a simple bug but a more nuanced "prompt adherence" problem, likely compounded by caching.

To the Development Team:
Subject: Action Required: Fine-Tuning the ASC 606 AI Analyst's Prompt Adherence

Hi Team,

First, thank you for the excellent work on the ASC 606 AI Analyst application. The backend architecture is robust, and the core analysis is performing well. We are now in the fine-tuning stage and have identified several high-priority inconsistencies where the final memo output does not align with the logic and rules we've implemented in step_prompts.py.

The core issue appears to be incomplete prompt adherence. While the detailed step-by-step analysis is largely correct, the AI is making small, incorrect assumptions in the structured JSON data it returns. This "bad data" is then causing a domino effect, corrupting the summary sections (Executive Summary, Conclusion) and other parts of the memo.

Below is a comprehensive list of the remaining issues and our proposed fixes.

1. Hallucination of Variable Consideration and Judgments
Problem: The Executive Summary and Conclusion sections are incorrectly stating that the contract "includes variable consideration" and required "significant judgments." This directly contradicts the detailed analysis in Step 3 and Section 4, which correctly identify the contract as simple and fixed-price.

Root Cause Analysis: The AI model for Step 3 is not fully respecting the new critical instruction to keep the professional_judgments list empty and variable_consideration as "N/A" for simple contracts. It seems to be "hallucinating" complexity.

Proposed Fix: We need to be even more forceful. Let's elevate the instruction from a simple bullet point to a direct command at the very top of the prompt's task description.

File: step_prompts.py Function: get_step_specific_analysis_prompt Action: In the main prompt f-string, add a new "OVERRIDING RULE" section for Step 3.

# Find the start of the f-string and modify as follows:
return f"""You are an expert technical accountant...

# ADD THIS NEW CONDITIONAL BLOCK
{'**OVERRIDING RULE FOR STEP 3: This is a simple, fixed-price contract. Your response MUST reflect this. `variable_consideration` MUST be "N/A" and `professional_judgments` MUST be an empty list []. Do not invent complexity.**' if step_number == 3 else ''}

PRIMARY GUIDANCE FOR THIS STEP: {step_guidance}
# ... rest of the prompt

2. Incomplete Step 1 and Step 5 Analysis
Problem: Despite our instructions, the AI is still not providing a complete analysis for all five criteria in Step 1 and is returning an empty "Detailed Analysis" for Step 5.

Root Cause Analysis: This is a stubborn adherence issue. The model is finding a "shortcut" by providing a high-level conclusion without filling out the required details. The Python formatting logic for Step 5 also has a small bug, preventing it from rendering even if the data were present.

Proposed Fixes:

Strengthen the Prompt: We need to make the "fill out all fields" instruction impossible to ignore.
Fix the Python Formatter: The _format_general_step_with_filtering function needs a small correction to its logic flow.
Fix 2A: Strengthen the Prompt File: step_prompts.py Function: get_step_specific_analysis_prompt Action: Change the instruction from a bullet point to a direct command within the main task description.

*** YOUR CRITICAL TASK ***
- Analyze the contract and provide both structured step-specific assessment AND thematic narrative analysis. 
+ Analyze the contract and provide a structured analysis. **You MUST fill out every field in the JSON structure below.** Your primary output is the structured JSON; the narrative in `analysis_points` is secondary.

Fix 2B: Correct the Step 5 Python Formatter File: step_prompts.py Function: _format_general_step_with_filtering Action: The markdown_sections list needs to be passed into the special formatting logic for Step 5, not just used within it.

# Replace the entire function with this corrected version for clarity
@staticmethod
def _format_general_step_with_filtering(step_data: dict, step_name: str,
                                        conclusion: str,
                                        analysis_points: list,
                                        step_number: int) -> str:
    """Apply the Auditor's Method to Steps 1, 4, and 5: Filter out N/A components and format structured data."""
    markdown_sections = [
        f"### Step {step_number}: {step_name}",
        f"**Conclusion:**\n{conclusion}", "\n---\n",
        "**Detailed Analysis:**\n"
    ]

    # Corrected Step 5 Logic
    if step_number == 5:
        plan_formatted = False
        if step5_analysis := step_data.get('step5_analysis'):
            if plan := step5_analysis.get('revenue_recognition_plan'):
                for po_plan in plan:
                    po_name = po_plan.get('performance_obligation', 'Unknown PO')
                    method = po_plan.get('recognition_method', 'N/A')
                    justification = po_plan.get('recognition_justification', 'No justification provided.')

                    markdown_sections.append(f"â€¢ **{po_name} (Method: {method})**")
                    markdown_sections.append(f"  - **Justification:** {justification}")
                    plan_formatted = True

        if not plan_formatted:
            markdown_sections.append("No detailed revenue recognition plan was provided.")

        markdown_sections.append("\n---\n") # Add final separator
        return "\n".join(markdown_sections)

    # Existing logic for Steps 1 and 4 follows...
    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

3. Caching and Model Behavior
Problem: It's possible some of our previous fixes did not appear to take effect because of caching mechanisms (@st.cache_resource, @st.cache_data) or model variability.
Root Cause Analysis: Streamlit's caching is aggressive. If the inputs to a cached function don't change, it returns the old result. When debugging prompts, this can be misleading.
Proposed Action: During this debugging phase, please ensure you are clearing the Streamlit cache before each test run. This can be done by clicking the "Clear cache" option in the hamburger menu of the running Streamlit app or by restarting the server. This guarantees our prompt changes are actually being sent to the model.
Please prioritize these changes. The goal is to enforce strict adherence to our structured prompts to eliminate these inconsistencies once and for all.
