Hi [Developer's Name],

First off, great work on the initial architecture and build of the ASC 340-40 module. The foundation is solid and perfectly aligned with our scalable, multi-standard vision for the platform.

After a thorough business review of the user workflow, we've identified a series of high-impact refinements that will dramatically simplify the user interface, sharpen the application's focus, and improve the quality of the final output.

Please treat this as the project brief for the next iteration of the asc340 module.

High-Level Goal: Radical Simplification
The primary goal of this V2 is to overhaul the UI/UX. We will be moving from a tabbed interface to a clean, single-page design and refining every input field to ensure it is clear, purposeful, and directly linked to the ASC 340-40 accounting guidance.

Consolidated List of Required Changes (12 Items):
Here are the specific changes to be implemented in pages/asc340.py and its supporting logic.

Item #11 & #10: Redesign UI to a Single Page, Removing Tabs

Action: This is the most significant change. Please refactor pages/asc340.py to remove the st.tabs interface entirely.
Action: Reorganize all UI input fields onto a single, scrolling page. Use st.subheader and st.divider to create a logical flow with clear visual separation between sections. This eliminates the need for the empty Tab 3.
Item #12: Relocate the "Generate Memo" Button

Action: Place a single, prominent st.button("üìù Generate Policy Memo", type="primary", use_container_width=True) at the bottom of the new single-page layout. The analysis results should appear below this button upon successful execution.
Field-Specific Refinements:
Item #4: Revise File Uploader to be Required and Cost-Focused

Action: Change the file uploader's label to: Upload Policy Document for Analysis (Required).
Action: Change the field's status from Optional to Required. The "Generate Memo" button should be disabled until a file is uploaded.
Action: Update the help text to: "Upload the primary source document that governs the costs, such as a Sales Commission Plan or a standard SOW for fulfillment."
Item #1 & #6: Refine Cost Type to a Single-Select with Cost Categories

Action: The field currently labeled Contract Types in Scope is confusing. Please REMOVE it.
Action: We will replace it with a new, more logical field. The field previously labeled Cost Type should be enhanced as follows:
New Label: Primary Cost Categories in Scope
UI Control: Change from Dropdown to Multi-select Checkbox.
New Options:
[
    "Sales Commissions (External)",
    "Sales Commissions (Internal Employee)",
    "Sales Bonuses & Incentives",
    "Contract Setup & Onboarding Costs",
    "Customer Migration & Data Conversion Costs",
    "Fulfillment-Related Third-Party Fees",
    "Other (please specify in description)"
]

Status: This field is Required.
Item #5: Relabel "Policy Context Summary"

Action: Change the label for the main text area from Policy Context Summary (Optional) to Contract Cost Summary (Optional).
Action: Update its placeholder text to: e.g., "This policy will govern sales commissions for new enterprise contracts and standard setup costs for customer onboarding."
Item #3: Make "Policy Effective Date" Optional

Action: Change the Policy Effective Date field from Required to Optional.
Action: Implement a fallback in the backend: if the user leaves this blank, the memo's date should default to the date of generation.
Action (UI Polish): Please place this field in a two-column layout to save vertical space.
Item #2 & #7: Remove "Cost Timing Focus" Field

Action: Please completely REMOVE the Cost Timing Focus dropdown. It is not relevant to the ASC 340-40 analysis.
Item #8: Remove "Primary Memo Audience" Field

Action: Please completely REMOVE the Primary Memo Audience dropdown. The memo will be standardized for a technical accounting audience. The TO: line in the memo can be hard-coded.
Item #9: Remove "Materiality Threshold" Field

Action: Please completely REMOVE the Materiality Threshold number input.
This comprehensive set of refinements will result in a much cleaner, more intuitive, and more powerful tool. The new single-page layout, combined with the precise, purpose-driven input fields, will guide the user through a logical workflow and provide the AI with exactly the context it needs.

Please let me know if you have any questions or see any potential issues with implementing these changes.
