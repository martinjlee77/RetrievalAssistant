RE: Sales comm 01 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This memorandum outlines the accounting policy for the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions under ASC 340-40, as applied to VeritasLogic's FY2024 Sales Commission Plan. The policy establishes that the 5% sales commission on Total Contract Value (TCV) qualifies as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract and should be capitalized and amortized over the initial contract term. This approach ensures compliance with ASC 340-40 and aligns the recognition of commission costs with the revenue they help generate.

SCOPE ASSESSMENT The 5% sales commission described in the VeritasLogic FY2024 Sales Commission Plan is within the scope of ASC 340-40. The commission is calculated as a flat rate of 5% of the TCV, which includes recurring software fees, one-time license fees, and professional services fees for the initial contract term. According to ASC 340-40-25-2, these commissions are incremental costs directly tied to securing new customer contracts and are therefore subject to capitalization under ASC 340-40.
COST CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK Under ASC 340-40, sales commissions are classified as incremental costs of obtaining a contract if they are directly related to securing the contract. The 5% commission rate, triggered by a fully executed customer contract for a new logo acquisition, meets this criterion. As such, these costs should be capitalized as they are specifically incurred to obtain a contract and are not related to fulfilling the contract.
MEASUREMENT & AMORTIZATION POLICY The commission for a Commissionable Event is calculated as 5% of the TCV. According to ASC 340-40-35-1, the recognized asset should be amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Given that the commission is tied to the initial contract term, amortization should align with this period. Commissions will be amortized over the initial contract term, ensuring alignment with the systematic transfer of goods or services to the customer.

100,000TCV,thecommissionearnedis5,000 (5% of $100,000). This commission is capitalized as an asset and amortized over 36 months, the standard amortization period. The journal entry at the time of commission payment is:
Debit 'Contract Cost Asset' $5,000
Credit 'Cash/Payable' $5,000
Monthly amortization is recorded as:
Debit 'Amortization Expense' $138.89
Credit 'Contract Cost Asset' $138.89
This treatment aligns with ASC 340-40, ensuring that the costs to obtain contracts are appropriately recognized and matched with the revenue they help generate. CONCLUSION The policy framework for VeritasLogic's sales commissions under ASC 340-40 involves the capitalization of commission costs as contract cost assets, which are then amortized over the initial contract term. This approach ensures compliance with accounting standards and aligns the recognition of costs with the benefits they provide. The policy should be consistently applied across all relevant contracts to maintain uniformity in financial reporting.' (type: <class 'str'>)
