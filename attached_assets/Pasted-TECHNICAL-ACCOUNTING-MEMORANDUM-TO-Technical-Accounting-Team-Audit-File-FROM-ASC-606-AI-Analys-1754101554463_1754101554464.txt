Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
Conclusion:
The contract with Netflix constitutes a single distinct performance obligation: access to the streaming service, which is both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable under ASC 606.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Identification of Performance Obligations

The Netflix contract specifies a monthly subscription fee for access to its streaming service, which includes a library of movies, TV shows, and games. According to ASC 606-10-25-19, a performance obligation is distinct if it is both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable. The streaming service provides standalone functionality, as customers can independently access and consume content without additional services from Netflix. This satisfies the 'capable of being distinct' criterion. Furthermore, the service is separately identifiable because it does not involve integration with other services or modification of any other deliverable, fulfilling the 'separately identifiable' criterion. Therefore, the streaming service constitutes a single distinct performance obligation. An alternative treatment, such as considering each piece of content as a separate obligation, was rejected because the service is marketed and consumed as a comprehensive package, not as individual content items.

Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price for the Netflix subscription service is determined to be the fixed monthly fee of $15.49, with no variable or other complex considerations affecting the transaction price.

Detailed Analysis:

1. Fixed Consideration
$15.49 per month for the subscription service.

2. Total Transaction Price
$15.49 per month

3. Fixed Consideration Analysis
The contract specifies a fixed monthly fee of $15.49 for the Netflix subscription service, as evidenced by the invoice and pricing documents. According to ASC 606-10-32-2, fixed consideration is the amount that does not vary based on future events or customer actions. The subscription fee is predetermined and does not include any performance-based adjustments or penalties, confirming it as fixed consideration.

Supporting Contract Evidence:

Date Description Service Period Amount Tax Total 9/26/24 Streaming Service 9/26/24—10/25/24 $15.49 $1.03 $16.52 (Source: invoice.pdf)
Standard: Unlimited ad-free movies, TV shows, and mobile games Watch on 2 supported devices at a time Watch in 1080p (Full HD) Download on 2 supported devices at a time (Source: pricing.pdf)

Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
Conclusion:
The transaction price for the Netflix subscription is allocated entirely to the single performance obligation identified in Step 2, which is the provision of streaming services for a monthly fee. No variable consideration or discounts apply, and any changes in transaction price would be allocated proportionally.

Detailed Analysis:

No additional analysis was required for this step.
Step 5: Recognize Revenue
Conclusion:
Revenue from Netflix's subscription service is recognized over time as the service is provided continuously throughout the subscription period, satisfying the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606-10-25-27(a).

Detailed Analysis:

1. Revenue Recognition for Streaming Service Subscription
The contract specifies a monthly subscription fee of $15.49 for access to Netflix's streaming service. Under ASC 606-10-25-27(a), revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service, which is continuously provided throughout the subscription period. The straight-line method is used to measure progress, as it reflects the uniform access provided to the customer. Alternative recognition at a point in time was rejected because the service is not delivered at a single point but rather continuously over the subscription period.
