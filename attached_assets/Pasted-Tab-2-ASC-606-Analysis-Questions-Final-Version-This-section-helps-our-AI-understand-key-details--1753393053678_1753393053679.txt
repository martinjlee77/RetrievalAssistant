Tab 2: ASC 606 Analysis Questions (Final Version)
This section helps our AI understand key details about the contract that may not be explicitly stated in the documents. Your answers will guide the analysis.

Step 1: Identify the Contract
1.1 Collectibility

Question: Is it probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled?
UI Element: Dropdown
Options: Probable / Not Probable
Default: Probable
Help Text (?): If collection of the full contract price is not probable, a contract may still exist for a lesser amount that is probable of collection. If no amount is probable, a contract does not exist under ASC 606.

Question: Should all uploaded documents be evaluated together as a single deal?
UI Element: Dropdown
Options: Yes / No
Default: Yes
1.3 Contract Modification

1.3.1 Follow-Up Question: Have you also uploaded the original contract documents? (Dropdown: Yes/No)
Step 2: Identify the Performance Obligations
UI Display (Text Only): The AI will analyze the contract(s) to identify the distinct goods or services (performance obligations), including any customer options that may represent a material right. The results will be presented in the final analysis.
