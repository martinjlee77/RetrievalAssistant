Subject: Critical Fixes & Recommendations for the VeritasLogic.ai Blog Page

Hi [Developer's Name],

I'm writing to you about the blog.html page. First off, the page is well-built from a front-end perspective—the styling is consistent, and the JavaScript filtering works as intended. The content itself is excellent.

However, I’ve identified a critical, user-facing flaw and a major architectural issue that we need to address to ensure the blog is functional, scalable, and user-friendly.

1. Fatal Flaw: Broken Links to Individual Articles
The Problem: Links from other pages (like the homepage) that are meant to point to a specific article (e.g., /blog.html#what-is-rag) do not work correctly. They simply take the user to the top of the main blog.html page, forcing them to scroll and find the article they wanted to read.

Why It's a Fatal Flaw:

Broken User Experience: This is highly frustrating for users. When they click "Read More" on a specific post, they expect to land directly on that post, not a long list.
SEO Damage: Search engines cannot effectively index or rank individual articles because they don't have unique URLs. The entire value of the long-form content is lost from an SEO perspective.
Unshareable Content: It's impossible for a user to share a link to a specific article.
The Solution: Transition to a Multi-Page Blog Architecture The standard and most robust solution is to give each blog post its own separate HTML page. The main blog.html will become an index page that only shows the excerpts and links to the full articles.

Actionable Steps:

Create a Post Template: Create a new file, blog-post-template.html, that contains the shared header, navigation, and footer. This will be the template for all individual articles.

Create Individual Article Pages: For each <article> in the current blog.html, create a new, separate HTML file.

For example, the "What is RAG?" article with id="what-is-rag" should become its own file: what-is-rag.html.
Copy the full content of that article into its new file, using the template from Step 1.
Update the Main blog.html (Index Page):

Remove the full content (<div class="post-content">) from every article on blog.html.
Leave only the metadata, title, and excerpt (<div class="post-excerpt">).
Change the "Read More" links and the article titles to point to the new, individual HTML files. For example:
<!-- In blog.html -->
<article class="blog-post" id="what-is-rag" data-category="ai-technology">
    <!-- ... post-meta ... -->
    <h2><a href="what-is-rag.html">What is RAG? The AI Technology That Actually Cites Its Sources</a></h2>
    <div class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) makes AI cite its sources...[etc.]</p>
    </div>
    <!-- The full post-content div is REMOVED from this page -->
</article>

Update Sitewide Links: Go back to the homepage (index.html) and other pages and update any links that point to blog articles to use the new URLs (e.g., update blog.html#what-is-rag to point to what-is-rag.html).

2. Architectural Issue: The "Single-File" Problem
The Problem: The current blog.html file contains the full text of every single article.

Why It's a Major Issue:

Scalability: This approach is not scalable. As more articles are added, the file will become enormous, making the page extremely slow to load.
Maintenance: Adding or editing an article will require editing a massive, complex file, which is highly error-prone and inefficient.
Performance: Users are forced to download the content of every single blog post just to view the main blog list.
The Solution: The multi-page architecture described above in the "Fatal Flaw" section completely solves this problem. By making blog.html an index page, you ensure it remains small and fast, while the content is loaded only when a user clicks to read a specific article.

3. Minor Housekeeping
RSS Feed: The page links to an RSS feed at /blog.xml. Please ensure this file is actually being generated and exists at that location. If not, it will be a 404 broken link. If it's a feature for the future, I recommend commenting out the <link> tag for now.
Fixing the linking issue (Point #1) is the highest priority as it directly impacts the user's ability to navigate and engage with the content. Implementing the multi-page structure will resolve both the fatal flaw and the architectural issue simultaneously.

Please let me know if you have any questions about these changes. They will dramatically improve the functionality, performance, and maintainability of the blog.
